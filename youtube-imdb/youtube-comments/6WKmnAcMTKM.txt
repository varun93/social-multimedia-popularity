p23
aS"7/10 great watch!\nDead man down is one of those movies that is deep, well developed, flows \nwell, lets you get to know the primary characters. If there's a flaw it's \nthe lack of realism with the action scenes. But the story line makes up for \nit. Oddly enough, the female character is actually as interesting, maybe \nmore so, than the lead male."

p31
aS'If you watch this movie, don\'t look for realism in it, but try to figure \nColin\'s emotions while he exceeds himself beyond retribution and revenge. \nNoomi is as main character as Colin by my opinion.\nRecommend.\n\np.s. This kind of movies wouldn\'t be appreciated if they don\'t send message \nlike: "Blood demands blood" - $hit happens :) Still, a good movie.'

aS'millions of people have acne much worse than the scarring around the \n"monster\'s" eye. In many scenes it\'s barely noticeable.'
p42
aS"*Dead Man Down (2013)*\nA movie soaked in a pool of melancholy and deep-rooted sorrow out of which \narises an intense feeling of hate. To bad that such a dark and melancholy \nfilm with a perfectly balanced morbid atmosphere can turn into a purely \ncheap action-packed monstrosity with all the clichs of a Schwarzenegger / \nStallone actionmovie of the 80's.\nMy opinion here : \nhttp://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/2014/05/dead-man-down-2013.html"

p46
aS'Noomi usually makes better choices, but I guess the money Hollywood pays \ntrumps artistic integrity. This looks like a Stallone-esque shoot-em-up. I \ncan see why it flopped.'

aS'Sensacyjny film Czas zemsty z Collinem Farrelem i Noomi Rapace w rolach \ngwnych moecie obejrze do 16.07 tylko w Telewizji Tu i Tam - na \nkomputerze lub tablecie: http://bit.ly/czaszemsty'
p75
aS'Don\'t watch this trailer, unless you want to be confused and mislead. The \nwoman in the trailer has nothing to do with main plot which is main \ncharacter Victor trying to kill his boss for killing his family 2 years \nago. Via seduction and blackmail, the woman Beatrice persuades Victor to \nhelp her achieve her own bloody payback. The movie is more focused on Colin \nFarrel\'s character killing Terrence Howard\'s character with a side of \nromance and seduction with Noomi Rapace\'s character. If you like this \nsynopsis, you\'d love the movie. If not, you\'ll be like me going into the \nmovie expecting one thing and thinking "wtf is going on, did someone switch \nplots?" Trust me it\'s less confusing this way.'
