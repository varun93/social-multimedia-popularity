S"I was flipping around the TV last night and came across this. I wasn't \ngoing to watch but then I got pulled in. A great story and some really top \nnotch acting!"
p1
aS"Interestingly enough, Travers was ultimately very upset with the final \nproduct... apparently she cried throughout the premiere and wouldn't allow \nDisney to use the rest of her work."
p2
aS"I love that it's a smidge of Australian history, and the childhood scenes \ndepict Australia in her heat and glory. <3  This movie is amazing. <3"
p3
aS'I was so surprised by how much I loved this film! I went into it, without \nwatching trailers, thinking it was very different.. didnt expect it to be \nwhat it was! Great Film.. to people thinking they should watch this \ntrailer: Stop It!!! Just go watch the film!!:)'
p4
aS'walt disney was a freemason'
p5
aS'ok this is really bothering me....what did she throw out the window in the \nbeginning of the movie? I cant for the life of me remember....'
p6
aS'Does anyone know what the song is near the end?'
p7
aS'I loved this movie moved me so much!  I didn\'t know  why Mary Poppings \nthrilled me so much especially that part where Julie Andrews sings " Feed \nthe birds", I think this should have won the Oscar for best actress! Enma \nThompson was so great and superb  on this caracter!She played so well that \nwoman Ms. PJ Travers that thrilled me with her problems in childhood, why \nit was so difficult to handle her like a real Greta Garbo who put the \nDisney studios on the  knees, she had fear that they would distort story of \nthe book that was in the background a story of her own life,the love that \nshe had in her father.Tom hanks was also great as Walt Disney although I \nthink Disney was a little more cheerful,i do not think he was a \nmisogynistic as the infamous Meryl Streep of the old spoiled Hollywood said \n,she kissing  until woman in the mouth, this shameless!'
p8
aS'Ignore this trailer. Just came to it after watching the movie. Go watch it \nand enjoy, then come back here and tell others to do the same.'

aS'Is this movie worth watchin....should i watch it. Please tel me if it suks \nso i dont waste my time'
p11
aS'Hate this movie because I thought it is a film about the making of Mary \nPoppins and not a tear-jerking rip your heart out film.'
p12
aS'what is this story about '
p13
aS"Academy did a huge injustice to Emma this time, i am deeply in sorrow. \nAcademy has a membership of some nonsense fellowship who doesn't even know \nwhat acting is, I think Academy should have considered for six nominations \nin Best Actress category and sixth in future, despite their illogical \nrules. "
p14
aS'Saving mr banks '
p15
aS"possibly the most beautiful film i've ever seen :)"
p16
aS'Did not expect to like this movie as much as I did! Had me crying at the \nend.'
p17
aS'I cried when i saw this and i cried at the part that was even important to \nthe story haha '
p18
aS'I cried at the end and towards the end. '
p19
aS'I loved this movie...And one of my favorite actors is Tom  Hanks...He is so \ntalented and possesses such warmth,you immediately fall in love with \nhim...He was perfect choice for Walt Disney...So the combination Walt \nDisney + Tom Hanks just cant be wrong.... :) And of course I have to add \nthat Emma Thompson was impeccable too.\nP.S. And those who are bashing Walt Disney for being " illuminati " or \nwhatever,cut it out ! If it wasnt for him,we would never had a chance to \nsee all those beautiful cartoons,that made our childhood so much better,and \nmany of us are still loving it and watching it...Maybe he wasnt perfect ( \nno one is ) but at least he gave all those children ( including me ) a \ndreamworld,where everything is beautiful and possible...'
p20
aS'just watched it...loved it.'
p21
aS'I know that it\'s just a movie and that in order to keep costs down, they \nneed to make sacrifices, but anyone who knows anything about Disneyland \nknows that "Fantasyland" looked like medieval circus back then. It wasn\'t \nuntil 1980s that they changed the facade of each ride to match the theme. '
p22
aS"ha ha, wow Disney, way to suck your own dick. This movie isn't really about \nthe creator of Mary Poppins, it's about glorifying Walt Disney and \npresenting a fake story that is feel good and makes Disney look like the \nheroes. I love Tom Hanks, but I can't stomach movies like this. Look it up, \nwhy have their never been anymore movies based on her works? She wasn't \nmoved by the film, she was so disgusted by it that she cried in \nfrustration. That's the magic of Disney!! "
p23
aS'Can you tell me what is the music in the trailer....thank you'
p24
aS'Is that really mr Walt Disney? '
p25
aS'The tears '
p26
aS"this movie should be called Saving Two Hours.. from wasting your precious \ntime.. That woman's accent was extremely annoying. As much as I love Tom \nHanks, I couldn't watch this movie. Luckily he redeemed himself with \nCaptain Phillips which was way better.. He's still a brilliant actor \nregardless"
p27
aS'Is there a song name for the last song played??'
p28
aS'This is a terrible movie. Miss travers is a awful person. she treated \neverone terribly. The others were so accommodating for her but she just \ntrashed their ideas. The movie is subpar and my family fell asleep at the \n30 min mark. '
p29
aS"Don't get me wrong, I love Disney's Mary Poppins, but would anyone like to \nsee a non-musical remake of Mary Poppins closer to the original books by \nP.L. Travers "
p30
aS'Emma Thompson deserved a nomination for her performance, she stole every \nscene'
p31
aS'tom hanks look like Hitler in this movie lol'
p32
aS"Saving Mr.Banks is such a sad story, I saw it and cried because it's sad \nbut it is AMAZING!!! If you haven't seen it yet theme go see if anyone you \nknow has it or buy it, then curl up with a box of tissues and watch the \nmost beautifully written movie!!! :-)"
p33
aS"I hate this movie. It's so boring. "
p34
aS'This film is incredibly funny, but also incredibly sad, expect to cry.'

p47
aS'They should advertise it as Two-Time Academy Award Winner Tom Hanks and Two \nTime Academy Award Winner Emma Thompson.'
p48
aS'lol :D'
p49
aS'I want a movie depicting Walt Disney from his conception and creation of \nDisney all the way to his death. And make the tone dark and serious rather \nthan light and funny. '
p50
aS'I loved this film so so so much!! '
p51
aS"This film looks awesome! I know it was already in theaters, but I didn't \nget to see it then. I really want to see it. Especially since Tom Hanks is \nin it. His role of Woody was amazing! And now he gets to play the role of \nWalt Disney himself! That's a huge honor!"
p52
aS'Love this film!'
p53
aS'A truly inspirational movie.'
p54
aS'Just watched "Saving Mr. Banks" very entertaining for the kids at heart. \nTom Hanks is always placed at the heart of amazing movies and I don\'t know \nhow or why but his characters always make me tear up! Disney is truly a \nmagical place. '
p55
aS'I watched " Saving Mr Banks". It was cool, though not my genre. '
p56
aS"Beautiful movie!!! I'm surprised that both the leading actors (and \nespecially Emma Thompson) didn't get an Oscar nominee!!! But again, I \nseriously doubt the Academy's competence..."

aS'Awesome movie '
p59
aS'I watched the movie it is sad but outstanding I would recommend this to all \nmy friends :D'
p60
aS"Boring. Could've been, Should've been a way better movie. We get no real \ninsight into what and why Mary Popping was created. This movie left me with \nmore questions than answers. Also made the Pamela character so incredibly \nunlikable. I say skip it. ** Stars poorly written drivel. "
p61
aS"I remember seeing this in the theater and thinking eh it might be ok. \nAbsolutely loved this film and Emma Thompson should have won an academy \naward for her performance. It's just one of those movies that surprises you \nwith a lot of heart and humor."
p62
aS'omg... i watched the movie... i cried... im a guy...'
p63
aS"My favourite movie of all time!!! Emma Thompson is brilliant in this, she \nmade such an unlikeable person likeable. I don't usually tear up at movies \nbut I cried like a baby when I saw this"

aS'DOes anyone know the name of the song that starts at 2:09?'
p68
aS'It was one of the few Disney movies I watch. "Mary Poppins" was my \nfavourite musical of all time. "Saving Mr. Banks is a decent movie. I give \nthis movie 4/5 stars. I thoroughly enjoyed "Saving Mr. Banks".'

p72
aS'There should be a movie about Walt Disney working with AA Milne on Winnie \nthe Pooh.'
p73
aS'The trailer does not do justice to the pathos of the performances. Both \nThompson and Hanks give brilliant performances, as expected. '
p74
aS"Can someone please tell me why this wasn't even nominated for best \npicture?!"
p75
aS"I just finished and let me say... I don't cry easily. But this movie \nreminded me of so many things and past moments from my own life that it was \nreally hard not to. Brilliant. "

p84
aS'No'
p85
aS'I wonder what P.L. woulda thought about this'
p86
aS'"Based on the untold true story"  If it\'s untold, how is is a true \nstory...or a story at all if it hasn\'t been told?  It\'s a told story, so \nbasically it\'s "Based on a true story" '
