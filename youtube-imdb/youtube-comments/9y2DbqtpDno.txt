p3
aS'So glad that the other version of the trailer was done. Most of the video \nis the same, but the mood in the Scala & Kolacny Brothers "Creep" cover \nfits much better to the same scenes depicted. Don\'t think that many people \nwould have watched the film based on this version of the trailer. Great \nshare though, these 2 trailers are a great example of contrast.'

aS'This trailer sucked. It made The Social Network "cool" with its musical \nscores, like a bad highschool movie. Finchers trailer di more of an \nimpact, it really set you in the mode of the whole thing, not spoiling any \ngood fun in it. This one grabs all of the catchphrases and tries to create \na recap around that. It just doesnt work.'
