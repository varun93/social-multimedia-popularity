p5
aS"OMFG years!! I've literally been writing for this for ever! Step dance \nmovie series is legit the bet thing to have ever happened, at least to my \nlife. It is what truly inspired me to become a dancer and I hope it \ncontinues. Step up all in scares me a bit because I feel as tho this is it \nbut I wish the series can go on for a little longer. Funny thing is I would \nhope to be in this even if it were a tiny micro part. Love Step Up & Step \nUp FAM <3 "
