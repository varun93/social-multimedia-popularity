S'This movie is such a fucking bullshit! It sends such a wrong message to \nyoung people!'
p1
aS'To anyone that has seen this movie, do you think it is worth downloading?\n'
p2
aS"One reason.\nDylan o'brien. "
p3
aS'Just watched this movie on TV. Welcome to Google.'
p4
aS"Stiles!!!!!!! OMG! Him with Glasses and a Beenie is too cute, idk why he \ndidn't keep that look, I'm mesmerized by it.\n\n"
p5
aS"This movie was AWFUL!\nIt was very tedious and I found it a painful chore to watch - completely \nuninspired drivel. Its just the same formula as a million other dull, \npredicable and ultimately forgettable 'comedies' based on the standard \nAmerican comedy template. It may appeal to the easily entertained but true \nmovie buffs should avoid this like the plague! (Yes, I really found it that \nbad)."
p6
aS'SPOILERS. This movie was just one long cheezy ad for google. Like the brand \nneeds it, its everywere. But now it wants to ram some \nstereotypical-american dream-morality down our throats?\nFull of stereotypes and condescention. Like ye old "lets show these nerds \nhow to live and have fun" for ex. Or  the asian kid with a strict mother \nand the really stern indian boss- there is a thin line between parody and \nrascism. Because its to much of this out there. At best its boring.\nIts trying to (?) have a positive message at the end, like everyone is \nimportant as long as they work hard together and are nice - but it just \nends up feeling, to me, as promoting a hirarchy of "acceptable \npersonalites". Like if youre a smart "geek" you have to change and become \nmore mainstream??....i guess?!?!  Like...... DONT JUST STAND AROUND DOIN \nMATH, LETS GO TO A (STRIP) CLUB!!! I thought the chick would have a problem \nwith it a little bit at least, but NO....it was because she was a \nvirgin!!!!  OH FOR FUCK!!!! SAKE!!!!!!!!! Yeah, and im a straight guy. Deal \nwith it.\n\nAnd the end made me cringe - so transparent and vulgur, as in it being an \novert ad for google in a real We are the world sort of way. Yuck! Look, the \ndream of the internet being the global-village is so ninties. It failed.\nIve come across versions of this plot a bunch of times. But this was maybe \nthe worst one. They clearly put very little time into the script. This is \none of those overly re-used formula plots. But its 2013...when are they \ngonna evolve from making this movie again and again, with minor cosmetic \nalterations?! It could of been made in the eighties man!!! (without the \nsame tech of course ;). This is sooo eighties. This crap made me angry, and \nits an insult to audiences everywere....just have another movie, any movie, \nready for when u just cant stand it anymore. Flashdance perhaps?\n\n\nAnd I KNOW that the response im gonna get from a bunch of apologists \nare....youre taking this way to seriously loser its just a comedy!\n\nMaybe i am. But it wasnt funny, too me.\n\n/Sorry for the spelling mistakes.'
p7
aS"It's funny how I read through the comments and like three quarters of what \nI read is bout Dylan XD"
p8
aS"Dylan O'Brien <3 He's probably the only reason I'll watch this movie :3"

aS'   - !??,    ,     \n      ,    \n ,      -      \n  ............        \n      ,       - \n   -  ,     ,   \n  ??????????????????'
p10
aS"Weird to think if dylan o'brien hadn't got this role he wouldn't have ended \nup in the maze runner! Which is gonna be as big (if not bigger than things \nlike hunger games and divergent)! Cod like his role wasn't massive and no \nbody really cared about him massively on it ,(apart from teen wolf fans of \ncourse)! It just shows a small thing can lead to a massive thing "
