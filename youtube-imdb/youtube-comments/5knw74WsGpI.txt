p49
aS"Thomas Jane should get only leading roles after his A+ performance in The \nPunisher & The Mist. This movie to me & I'm sure many other's is a \ndowngrade for him. He must be hurting or & I do mean or he's doing someone \na big favor. The makers of this film are car buffs/copiers. Listen FF is in \na league of it's own,unmatched. Drive with Ryan was a good movie mostly \nbecause of the music at the right parts, good job people. This movie \ntrailer is just gay. Crush & Burn."
p50
aS'gta 6 hahaha'

p61
aS'Low budget movie.'
p62
aS'Looks like a damn good time to me!'
p63
aS"So is it some sort of clever reverse casting where Tom Jane is some ugly \nhippie fag and Cusak is the badass one? I would watch it if it the two guys \nhad the other guy's role."
p64
aS"haha i'm gonna watch this now"
p65
