aS"Barbra Streisand never disappoints.  I've been watching her movies and \nlistening to her music since I was 13 years old.  At 72 she is as good as \nshe was at 22.  It's amazing how good she looks and how brilliantly she \nperforms.  It is truly a privilege to watch her in any movie.  This was a \ngreat role for her, and again she touched my heart.  "

p92
aS"These misleading Hollywood trailers! First of all this shouldn't be \npresented as a comedy cause in fact its a feel good movie about mother/son \nrelationship on rocks with some funny moments. Even thought there could be \nmuch more done with a script (fairly said) its still enjoyable to watch if \nu got heart on right place. It also carries a great message for all of us \nliving busy lives far away from our mothers. "
