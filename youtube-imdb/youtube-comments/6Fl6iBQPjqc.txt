S"This movies title should be 'Let's make a movie about a fictional story of \nGringos murdering mexic. . . er I mean 'Dreamers' who just want a better \nlife so that we can establish in people's hearts that Americans are evil \nand illegal immigrants are good and Ed Harris represents the spirit of \ncondemnation of Americans for daring to want their laws enforced'. I think \nthat would be a more apt title. Just saying. "
p1
aS"Why don't they make a movie about US Border Patrol agents getting killed by \nMexican cartels and how the US gov't was involved in it?"
p2
aS'GO HOME.....FIX YOUR OWN DAM COUNTRY'
p3
aS'whites tell others to go back to their country ohh the irony,i guess they \nnever opened a history book'
p4
aS'Bring home all the troops and deploy them at the border, the real enemy is \nright here not half way across the globe.  The illegals drain our economy \nand the Drug Cartels are 80% of the drug problem coming into the U.S.'
p5
aS'What a perfectly timed movie for all the illegals...'
p6
aS'great movie! '
p7

p8
aS'Migration is a natural way of living of humans. Migration is hand with hand \nwith Universal History. Everybody of us came from Africa and spread through \nthe world, and human always has been moved from one place to another \nlooking for a better life. Migration is natural will never stop. Bad new \nfor racist, nationalist and chauvinistics.'

p12
aS'When does this come out? I real answer would be appreciated internet <3'
p13
aS'Its a tragedy what happens on the so called "first world countries" dont \nmatter if you take that border here, or what happens on the borders of \neurope. First we go there with our big fishing boats and take so much fish, \nthat there are none left for the local fisherman. Then we export out cheap \nmeat and wheat to that countries and sell it to a price that no local \nfarmer can match. Then we export our waste to that countries and ruin their \nenviroment. Then we buy cheap goods produced in that countries, because of \ntheir low income. Then we buy drugs form the country and support local drug \nlords and criminals. And then, when they try to flee to a better world, we \njust say no or let them die. What would you do? '
p14
aS"It's sad how people are still racist. The saddest thing is that some white \npeople hate and always talk shit about blacks and Mexicans. They talk shit \non the internet but when they get up close to either of them they fold like \na bitch and pretend they are cool and would never say anything bad. Smh!"
p15

aS'Its only a movie..  just enjoy it  all these  comments that have nothing to \ndo with the movie are Space Waste. If you dont wanna see it thats your \nRight as well.'
p37
aS"Without wanting to offend anybody that has posted comments here I think a \nlot of you need to read more about the country you call yours and its \nfoundations. The ONLY truly north americans were the native tribes, mostly \nextint now, those who suffer while their lands were invaded and their \nfamilies and lifes taken away by IMMIGRANTS, mostly from Europe and much of \nthem our desendence, who got to America running away from poverty and a \nvast majority from the catholic Church domination. Now having this \nbackground I don't understand why these immigrants have to be tres red like \ncriminals or like some of you ask them to stay in their countries...who do \nyou think you are to tell a Human Being what dreams to follow?? Most of \nthem are just looking for a better work, a safest place to raise your \nchildren or just a better life in general. Why do you consider yourself \nbetter somehow if you were actually born in this great country because of \nthe decision to IMMIGRATE of maybe your great great great...grandfather, \nwhy you dont judge your roots and consider yourself an immigrant too and go \nback yo where you belong?? The answer is one, this country is for the \npeople BY the people doesnt matter where you are from, we are all human \nbeings and as long as you are being a good citizen there is no reason to \nexclude anybody. While I dont agree with illegal immigration because of the \npolitical and cultural impact it brings, together with many deaths for \nHuman trafficking, I kind of understand mexicans, being a Cuban myself, I \nknow by heart that some governments are just imposible to change, even \nstaying there like some of you recommend. But i guess its easy to judge \nwhen you dont have a clue of what living in those kind of societies is. "
p38
aS'Looks Good.'

p41
aS'1:56 - what exactly does he say? I need it for my translation...'
p42
aS"Why do you folks always take these movies from a racial point of view and \nnot as it is... just a story. Why?\n\n{I'm Italian and if you read news from the world you should know we're \nhaving a huge immigration issue here. Those people have their own stories, \nwe all have our own...do we really wanna be judge about our story? As \nsomeone already commented, mankind history is all based on exodus. \nImmigration will always rule our history in its very largest scale, much \nmore than a single economic crisis, a single war or a single epidemic. One \nday we all may end up being forced to turn into immigrant ourselves. I pray \nfor you to never happen in yours life!}"

aS'So when did this start happening on the border ? Never heard of any real \nnews story in America about this kind of BS happening.  This made up story \nfrom racists, liberal, open borders, anti American, anti legal immigration \nmade up BS propaganda movie. Really sad more movies out there portraying \nmade up lies about America.  Hollywood trying hard to influence young \nAmericans by re-writing, destorting history or events and demonize America. \n I guess they just want shit like this to happen on our borders so they can \nhave a "I told you so" moment about cruel America and her cruel ways.

p81
aS'Immigration reform?\n\ncrawl across the border into mexico,......see where you end up.\n\nUsing the "you came to America" argument is a moot, BS, liberal, \nbrainwashed argument. We came to this country via English Colonization in \n1607. Columbus and the other Spanish explorers began moving into the \nAmericas in 1492,.....in that same time frame that Spain moved across S.A. \nThe United States emerged to become the most powerful nation on \nearth,........what did Mexico do? You have had 500 years to develop, just \nlike the US,.....but it is our fault you pissed the opportunities away?\n\nEvery other nation on the planet is allowed to control their borders,...but \nnot us?\n\nAll you have done is try to come and take advantage of a lifestyle here \nthat we built. Why isn\'t as important to you as a Latino to produce your \nown individuality in Mexico,.....instead of crawling across the border and \ntaking it away from those who were born here?\n\nNot even limited to those who were born her, but those who have come from \nthe poorest nations on the planet; scraping up every dollar they can, \nsaving every penny, filing out every document,......and coming here the \nlegal way. Nigeria, India, Pakistan, Ukraine, and so many others....\n\nWhy is right for everyone else to do it the right way,.....but South \nAmerican Latinos feel it is their birth right to say "fk the rules", and \nsneak across the border?\n\nYou do it because you can care less about being part of America, but you \nwant to take advantage of what America has built....so the rules they do \nnot apply to you.\n\nAnyone who wants to do the right things to come to this country legally, we \nopen our arms wide open to you,.......those who want to lie and cheat to \nget here, GO HOME, WE DO NOT WANT YOU HERE!'
