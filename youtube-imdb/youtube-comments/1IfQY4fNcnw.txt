p7
aS"Good movie! I enjoyed it! Especially for Ryan Reynolds. I'm not a fan of \nDenzel Washington but he is a fine Oscar-winning actor. Good choice of \nactors! Ryan Reynolds was able to hold his own with Denzel Washington."
p8
aS'Song is church in the wild!!'

p14
aS'the trailer was better then the movie'
p15
aS'Denzel is pursued by what must rank as the most inept hit squad in the \nhistory of Hollywood action movies barring or perhaps including comedies.'
p16
aS"it was a good movie, great action flow and camera work, good acting . \nBecause of the douche critics i didn't watch earlier ... but it was \nenjoyable,  if you like Bourne  and Taken movies... some people judge all \naction movies like they supposed be in the oscars ahahah.\nI rate it 8, solid action movie. imdb score for this movie is bullshit\n\nThe last scene was kind of gay, after doing what he did in the end, he \nshould be surround taking heavy fire from everywhere . ahah"
p17
aS'I wint\nTo see\nThis \nMovie soooooooo BAD'

p33
aS"Ryan Reynolds brought it in this film as did Zel as always.  I really liked \nhow Reynolds just played the role as written and didn't try to overdo it. \n Less is more type thing that really complimented Denzel's role.  Oh yeah, \nand the fight scenes were pretty sweet too."

p39
aS"This is how the trailer for The Equalizer should've looked. Compared to the \ntrailer to this movie, this movie seems like it's alot more fun and \ninteresting than The Equalizer, which looks boring and generic with the \nexception of the Eminem feat. Sia song in the trailer. How Denzel looks, \nacts, and moves in this movie and the cinematography in this movie is how \nhe should've been in the Equalizer along with the cinematography."

p46
aS'Great movie. Not a huge fan of Reynolds, but I must say his acting was on a \nhigher level than usual, probably because of Washington. He also had some \nbelievable action scenes (except for when he beat up those two cops \nhandcuffed). Otherwise it was awesome. Great ending too.'
