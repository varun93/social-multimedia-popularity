S'I hate how the persians are portrayed as monsters, while the greeks are \nportrayed as epic heroes... I know this is just a movie, but people are \nstupid, and they will believe what they see in the movies, especially since \nsome of this is based on real history... T_T'

aS'I liked the movie but I think the sex scene was silly, forced and \nunnecessary. Am I the only one who thought the sex scene ruined it ?\n '
p9
aS'i just watched this film, i was expecting it to be worse given the reviews. \nthe graphics were kinda hard to get past but Eva Green was SEXY AS FUCK! my \ngod i was just floored with her character in this movie, she hands down \nmade this movie watchable. '
p10
aS"This is simply the most epic trailer I've ever seen."
p11
aS'WW2 was the closest thing to a modern day Battle of Thermopylae we will \nsadly ever see; Germany, the last free nation of earth, faced with an all \nout invasion from all the worlds superpowers (Britain, Russia and America) \nEventually being defeated by sheer numbers and brutality, despite \npossessing the greatest soldiers in modern history. They may have died, but \nthey proved that freedom is not free and that at the end of the day, even a \ngod can bleed.'

aS"Stopped watching this dissrectful unhistorical peice of shit 3 mins into \nthe movie. Why you may ask? Because the man behind the battle of Marathon \nwas Militatiades not Themistocles. This is dishonrable to Miltiades legacy, \nstealing peoples achievements is disgusting, I didn't expect this to be \n100% percent accurate seeing as they aren't even in a phalanxes but \nsomething as simple as naming the right fucking person,  fucking lame."

aS"I wish they made movies that were attempted to be historically authentic. \nThis stuff is just made for the purpose of doing well financially. This \nkind of stuff is a disservice to film and to the integrity of ancient \nhistory. Still worse movies out there but common, can't mainstream films be \ndone well anymore? "
p36
aS'No mater how brave the Greeks, no mater how numerous the Persians, both are \ndefeated by Arabs'
p37
aS"The movie was great, though I'd have preferred if they had a man for a \nGeneral on the Persian side. I suppose having a female General sells as it \nstrikes youngsters imagination who know nothing about warfare, but I \ncouldn't help thinking if it was real, she'd obviously lose the battle \nquicker from spending too much time singing karaoke. Great movie!"

p43
aS'Wow this movie looks sooooooo boring.'
p44
aS"Good, but not as good as the first movie. The main character Themistocles \nhowever, I'll be hung for saying this, is so much more awesome than \nLeonidas "
p45
aS'hoala acabo de enteraeme de la segunda parte de 300 la primera me encanto \nmucho espero verlo  grasias por compartirlo conmigo'
p46
aS"They always have to have a woman in a main role? Women of the world, you \nare not equal to men. All great battles fought over centuries to determine \nhow we live today were fought by men. A women in that time was inferior to \nmen and wouldn't have been given the time of day!"

aS'I am one of many within our circles who liked the first 300, and know of \nFrank Miller\'s works, however, many of us skipped this in the theaters. It \nwas good, but we were way past 300 and it\'s themes. I mean, promoting the \n"West" against the nations of the Middle East, it became kinda annoying and \ncheesy.\nI watched it today with friends in our farm, downloaded of course, we \ncouldn\'t digest it very well..\nMany of my friends, and I, lost complete interest in 300 and its like..\nMany of my friends hate Persians, however, with this movie? They were \nrooting for them against the Spartans! Lmao.'
p51
aS'xerxes is still alive at the end of this movie'
p52
aS'The persians were zoroastrainsim witch forbid slavery so in persia slavery \nwas almost unheard of. While the Spartan kingdom only worked because they \nhad a huge mass of horribly misstreated slaves. The persians were overall \npretty dreamy and if I had to live in the 5th century BC I would have \nwanted to live in persia.'
p53
aS'This movie is shit. '
p54
aS'wow! the greeks and the persians really do speak GOOD BRITISH ENGLISH \nslang... '
p55
aS' This is NOT how it went down. Sparta and greece were the first facist \ncountry/countries to ever excist. If compared with today, they would most \nlikely be fighting for North Korea or Sovjet Union. However Persia at this \npoint in time was the most advanced technology developed country in the \nWorld. They had/have a extremly peaceful religion and they focused their \nresources on economic and productive growth within the country lines. (ca) \nIf I were to go back, i would pledge my life to the persian lifestyle. They \nare if compared with today a smudge between Germany and Spain, exotic \nlifestyles, extremly proactiv and ecofriendly to the environment.'

p59
aS"I can't stand how they make Greeks look white in this film just so white \npeople can feel included. Greeks aren't white! Have the film makers ever \nseen a Greek in their lives? Black hair, brown eyes, olive skin is how the \nmajority of Greeks look!"
p60
aS'Stupid, senseless plot, unlikable hero characters, British accents that \nover-dramatize everything, and fake CGI jello blood constantly flying in \nyour face. 110 million dollars well spent!'
p61
aS"hey guys remember this is a movie, i'm persian and feel insulted because \nour king looks like a pedofile, in real life it was different. xD"
p62
aS"Oh, no again... Women with weapons... It's already boring"
p63

aS'Holy cow, Eva Green.'
p67
aS'I read a lot of the other comments and I\'ll borrow the highlights that \nmatched how I feel most closely.\nFoul, racist American propaganda painting the great and enlightened Persian \nempire as a bunch of savages. The "suicide bomber" was particularly \nsickening.  Spot on with this comment. This is an example of a film that \nshould never make it past the drawing board. (another pretty close feeling \nto what I had watching it). Ugh! Down right awful! (short but to the \npoint). If they changed eva green\'s character to a male character and \ntweaked the story i mean a lot it would have a shot. (this is closest \nthough to how I really felt).  In what world are people stupid enough to \nwatch these chicks lead armies fighting with the men.  At on point the \nqueen raises a sword, and all it\'s missing is her screaming VAGINA POWER!! \nwith like a rainbow or something, that\'s the only way I could have thought \nto make this movie any worse and honestly it may have made me laugh so that \ncould have even been an improvement.   The only thing I\'ll take away from \nthis movie other then my head hung low, will be to know that if I ever lead \na country that\'s a huge world power with 10\'s of thousands of ships maybe I \nshouldn\'t let an 80 pound slave ship slut have complete control of them.   \nIt a strange situation to be at the end of a movie hoping that the guy \nbeats the girls azz in moral combat.  I\'d say more but I feel I\'ve put a \nlot more effort into this comment then the movie was worth.'

aS"Both nations were great at the time, I just don't like how the movie makers \ndepicted them in the movie, I mean an Athenian general with strong Scottish \naccent... it is super distracting, and do I have to say anything about \nPersian appearance... I know it is a based on comic book but they over do \nit, they could dim it a bit. Persia was one of the most tolerant empire \never, but they presented them as an alien weirdos. "

aS'hey girls we really need to tell the guys the truth about having periods. \nthey think having girls as heroes or villains in a movie will not make a \ndfference at all. They play a big role on a movie. And evry month girl \nactresses have periods, which can affect their schedule on shooting a \nmovie. So girls remember, use a red towel whenever having periods, not a \nuse a white towel. Because if its white, oh guddamn Japan flag. So atleast \ni made myself clear here.'
