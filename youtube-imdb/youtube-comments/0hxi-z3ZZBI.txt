aS'@boredbeyondrepair It is but not everyone finds it funny.'
p14
aS'Because the trailer was ripped off of Apple Trailers clearly.'
p15
aS'Watch out butthead! Biff Tannen is behind you in a black suit in 1:25 !!!'
p16
aS"@LiamCrowley1990 No I'm not! Paranoid is what people call you when they \nwant you to drop your guard. I've seen that in a lot of movies, the fact \nthat the rest of the credits are the same doesn't mean that they didn't \nmean it that way. They use a lot of trickery in publicity in order to get \nyou interested, whatever woks. Every time I watch a trailer with a renown \nproducer/actor you can never read their role, so I wouldn't think its \ncoincidental, publicity is always misleading, that's their job."
p17
aS"@PollockQT You're an idiot. They usually use a smaller font for the role \nand larger font for the name in most trailers. Also, it wasn't just for \nexecutive producer, it was a small font for the director, etc. as well. \nYou're just babbling shit to try and allure to having an air of \nintelligence to people reading this but your misdirection failed and you \njust look like a prick.

aS"good memories of watching this and dying of laughter with my sister :')"
p22
aS"@PollockQT Well you shouldn't have fallen for it in the past but fair \nenough. Also, the reason Matt Damon's puppet looks the way it does in Team \nAmerica is because the manufacturer fucked up, it was Damon and Clooney who \nsuggested the Damon doll be retarded because of that as they're good \nfriends with Trey Parker and Matt Stone."
p23
aS'Mark Whitacre= Jason Bourne LOL'

p31
aS'richard wagner the ryde of the valkyries...'
p32
aS'i was an extra and i heard matt damon say, "what the heck is goin on here?" \nlike 13 times. filming is really strenuous even for the small roles. as far \nas corn conspiracies... yes, maybe its boring, I can see why you say that, \nbut CORN is a BIG F\'ing business. HUGE.'
p33
aS"@minirayray123 it's from Apple's itunes trailers dude,,, or some other \nApple Trailer App or something like that,,,"
p34
aS"@PollockQT Wow, witty stuff. I really don't want to argue with you anymore, \nthis has strayed too far from my original point for me to care anymore."
p35
aS'@LiamCrowley1990 Happy people do tend to be angry... But I guess your just \nthat special.'
p36
aS'the real guy who matt damons playing is name is mark whitecare my dad rites \nhim'
p37
aS'i mean, Matt Damon isnt considered ugly or goofy looking either. thats why \nthey gave him a stupid mustache. its really easy to make any one look \nreally ugly. Such as Edward Scissorhands who was hideous yet played by \nAmericas heart-throb...but i can definitely agree with your first statement'
p38
aS"I would eat matt damon's dick as if it was corn."

aS'"And the BBC must have taken away about eight hours footage a day, and they \ngot it back, and most of it was like, you know, Oh look here\'s a good guy. \nHe\'s gettin\' on, he\'s their friend as well as their boss... Uh, um, he\'s a \nmotivator, an entertainer... Lots of good stuff. Oh he\'s made one mistake \nlike any human would, should we just cut that out? No, what? Put that bit \nin, cut the other stuff out. We want a scapegoat, we want a dumb-down, we \nwant to give them the biggest plonker of the year."'
p45
aS"@LiamCrowley1990 David Brent said that. And that is exactly why Matt Damon, \nlooks like his alter ego in Team America: publicity. I used to fall for all \nthe things I've just mentioned when I was a kid. And I get in there, hoping \nto see George Clooney or whoever, only to sit through a pile of boring shit \nuntil the credits came out and realized he was just a producer or \nsomething.Now that would be a very lucky coincidence that got me to pay for \na ticket but it'd be foolish not to do it if it works"

aS'@PollockQT Nice Python quote but I still don\'t care. I did have a "definite \nproposition", to point out that they weren\'t using trickery to make you \nthink Clooney was in the film but that all the role fonts were all small \nand the same size and that you were being paranoid about the producers \ntrying to give the movie extra star credit. You\'re drawing some hidden \nmeaning from the credits that doesn\'t exist, they\'re just credits.'

p91
aS"he seems rather incompetent doesn't he?"
p92
aS'@LiamCrowley1990 Like when they announce: "From the people that brought you \nX", the usual assumption would be it\'s the director, but it\'s usually the \nproducers. Now why would you care who produced it? The real work comes from \ndirectors, producers just want to profit from it. Or with sequels, most of \nthe times the people that made the original have nothing to do with it, \nstill the producers are usually still involved so that they can market it \nthat way. I don\'t believe in accidents in publicity.'
p93
aS'I read this book 2 times and if this movie is anything like the \nbook.....BOY!!!! are we in for a ride!!!!!!! By the way...I used to work \nfor Archer, Daniel, Midland in Buffalo, New York for a short time and they \nnever once mentioned Mark Whitacre. Smart Boys!!!!'

aS'Well, that "evil guard from Shawshank Redemption" is the amazing Clancy \nBrown... And yup, that\'s definitely him !'
p96
aS'Did you realize how they put Geroge Clooney\'s name on the credits for a \nvery short time and used small caps for "Executive Producers" to give the \nmovie extra star credit and lead people into believing he\'d also be on \nscreen? I mean, they didn\'t lie about it, people\'s perception\'s lead them \nto believe that, they might have done it on purpose, but it was other \npeople who might misread or misunderstand the credits. It\'s all about \nmisdirection, notice how they made him look stupid in the trailer?'
