S'beautiful Film :D'
p1
aS'WATCH IT!! thats what I have to say because this movie will have you \nguessing till the end. Watching the trailer you are probably like she not \ndead, shit the first 10 min of the movie you know she not dead, but omg the \nthings that happen as you watch it you start going crazy like maybe she is \ndead and they just throw you off completely till the end so dont listen to \neveryone go watch it for yourself '
p2
aS'that movie is totally misleading from the truth,this aint even a close of \nwhat\'s an after life really looks like.you should have give this another \ntitle like "weird nightmare" that would have been more better!'
p3
aS'Before LIFE'
p4

p13
aS'hi , i m looking for a special movie i found on utub, but they erased it \nwith the title as well and no famous actors, it s very special, it s a guy \nwho die and the rest of the movie is him flying and witness his relative, \nfriends or enemy the cam is set first person like in some game, the \ndirector isn t famous but if you know abous cinema then you might help me, \nthanks in advance. it s not a classic horror , or even an horror style \nmovie , more of an experimental movie'

A dead person will not get goose bumps.  \nShe was buried alive."
