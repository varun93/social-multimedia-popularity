S'\n"The Adjustment Bureau" is a pretty old movie and it fell a bit off the \nradar, but it has an interesting plot, good casting, an absorving story and \na good pace. Unfortunatelly, the ending leaves a bit to be desired... It\'s \nnot a bad ending, by all means, it\'s just a very weak one and it leaves \nmany questions unanswered... I was expecting more, but still, it\'s pretty \ndecent and it deserves a look.'

aS"Railroading by GMs seems to be a fairly popular subject amongst role \nplayers... I don't like the contrived nature of such techniques.\nHowever it got me to thinking about a possible game whereby the GM plays \ncharacters who actively seek to railroad the lives of the player characters \nwho are aware of this and this is the whole point of the game... to know \nrailroading is going on... and to try and stop it happening to your \ncharacter.\n\nThe Adjustment Bureau Official Trailer #1 - (2010) HD"
