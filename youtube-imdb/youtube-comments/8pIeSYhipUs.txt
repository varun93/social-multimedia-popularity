S'Like if you agree that this movie sucked and a total complete waste of time \nan hour forty five minutes of life wasted'
p1
aS'I liked it....'
p2
aS"Oh yes.... This movie..... I've got two words for this movie \n\nElfen Lied"
p3
aS'elsa do you want to make a hybrid'

aS'OMG this is crazyyyyyyy.....................'
p5
aS'Sundance 2011\n\n---\n"If there\'s one thing I know, it\'s never to mess with mother nature, mother \nin-laws and, mother freaking Ukrainians."  --Skinny Pete in the movie The \nItalian Job.\n\n---\nThis quote has special meaning to me because I once nearly had a \nmother-in-law that was also a Ukrainian (and it would have been doubly \nreally bad); and then there was this...'
p6
aS'Are you kidding me? This movies preety badass. To each their own i guess'
p7
aS"The first half hour of the movie was actually good. It had a somewhat \nunique premise but it gets so ridiculously weird so fast you don't even \nrealize how it got there. The ending is just plain bad. It's absolutely \nhorrible. Especially the 'Inside You' part. Even Adrien Brody and Sarah \nPolly (otherwise fantastic actors) seemed somewhat disinterested in the \nentire project."
p8
aS'CATWOMAN OF GOTHAM!!'
p9
aS"This gotta be the worst movie ever... Just watched it today and... well.. \ndon't watch it. Its shit."
p10
aS'Really bad!'
p11
aS'Watched this in 2010 :/'
p12
aS'Search "mental wealth" by sony instead of this trailer.'
p13
aS'needed more explicit scenes'
p14
aS'Egy kalap szar'
p15
aS'the ending was disturbing :/'
p16
aS'zzzz'
p17
aS'       .     \n'
p18
aS'this movie is not bad but not great'
p19
aS'me parecio interesante, lo pase bien'
p20
aS'Is this a Half Life 3 Gameplay?'
p21
aS'I am sayings the 4years old kid to remember this video is18+\n'
p22
aS'Pop off time'
p23

p25
aS'That nasty motherfucker fucked the specimen'
p26
aS'is this movie any good?'
p27
aS'Always funny how this trailer makes it look like a horror movie, while it \nis everything but.'
p28
aS'average movie, a lot of it is just stupid and gay'
p29
aS"Comes on tonight at 12:00 AM IFC..if you haven't seen it ending is really \nmessed up..."
p30
aS"I was hoping it to be good but almost half way through it got really \nstupid. There is no unleashing anything into the world. They took her to a \ndam farm and it just stays there with her learning to be human or whatever \nthen the 2 main characters argue with each other for no apparent reason. \nThen towards the end its 10 min worth of horror when some people looking \nfor the creature in a swamp then they kill it that's it. If you want to see \na movie like this but actually has some alien/human running around killing \npeople watch Species."
p31
aS'this movie just goes hammmmm at the end. xD'
p32
aS'this movie was sick,but great '
p33
aS'just watched this movie last night....very interesting but straight \nSIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKKKK....'
p34
aS'coming soon to the world'
p35
aS"when I first saw this trailer in'09 I didn't want to sleep"
p36
aS'lmao'
p37
aS'The movie was actually kind of interesting. Up until the rape part. That \nwas just unnecessary.'
p38
aS'I like this movie'
p39
aS'@Lily Pham yeah i hate that. its SUCH a common occurence in real life.'
p40
aS"she wasn't smart enough to understand it. Shame really but thats why this \nwill happen."
p41
aS'i dont want to talk about it. the movie was good but the ending kills it \nall. i did some looking up on parahuman research, and i can tell you, the \ndirector of this movie didnt do his homework.'
p42
aS'pfffff .... ~___~ ALIEN MUCH ???'
p43
aS'This movie was ... fucked up and weird... I usually like that kind of \nmovie... but this... not so much... '
p44
aS'love this movie '
p45
aS"Maybe you just didn't pay any attention to the movie."
p46
aS'u deserve my like. i puked when the guy n the thing went bang bang'
p47
aS'Ok umm the ending is strange, dren was like: inside of you and that was \ndisturbing....'
p48
aS'BioShock The Movie.'
p49
aS'This happened with the earlier creation but they weren\'t paying attention. \nThey became emotionally attached to "their child".... and so did we. It\'s \nreally topical, I think.'
p50
aS"I can't tell what the fucks going on, it's just a load of flashing :L"
p51
aS'Dren !! Looks scary.'
p52
aS'SCP ! :D'
p53
aS'wow '
p54
aS"Odd movie, reminds me of Dr. Moreau, Species, David Cronenberg's works and \nthat Batman TAS episode"
p55
aS'was based on the anime elfen lied '
p56
aS"This movie is disgusting. One of my friends watched it and told me that \nit's very gross. That's one ugly baby. I don't like it when a women \nspontaneously turns into a man."
p57
aS"Why are they still using the Book of Old SCI-FI stories to wright plots for \nmovies ? She Looks like an Over-grown Fetus, and why every lab experiments \ncomes out as a weapon ? Why do the governments in these type of movies \nwould always use Beasts as a weapon that's so contradictory."
p58
aS'It looks like a H. G. Wells rip-off!'
p59
aS'if i remember right the "creature" turnd into a male and raped the women \nscientist and then she got pregnent Carrying the creature"'
p60
aS'Its on tonight channel4'
p61
aS'This was horror porn'
p62
aS'"Get this torrent"'
p63
aS'fantastic film'
p64
aS'i will still be fascinated by it.'
p65
aS'This movie was weird , freaky and disturbing but it was ok'
p66
aS"Honestly, this has already probably already happened in the world. The \nscientist conducting experiments that end badly and then getting rid of the \nevidence, they don't tell the public what's going on because it would start \na bunch of unwanted shit. Uproars, people trying to find out more, \nexclusion Etc. Personally, I like this movie because it sorta gives us an \nidea on what the government is doing without our knowing. "
p67
aS'This movie sucks, it suckidie sucks the sucks out of sucks'
p68
aS'the movie makes sense, except for the ending part.'
p69
aS'wow this movie will be all about cells come out together'
p70
aS"It's basically about scientists creating creatures inspired by penises (and \ndemons, but if you actually want to give this film your time, that isn't \nthe unsubtle reference you'll be getting the entire time)."
p71
aS'Actually she could be caring a regular baby because she had unprotected sex \nwith her Boyfriend.'
p72
aS'so many parts of it made no sense... like why the human hybrid had a \nscorpion tail when it was only spliced with non-predatory flora and fauna, \nor why it for some reason turns into a dude'
p73
aS'reminds me of Species (1995)'
p74
aS'Well thank you good sir for spoiling the movie... No point in watching it \nanymore.'
p75
aS'yeah, like it really has good ideas and good elements and sxxt but defo \nshould have worked more on the screenplay... :)'
p76
aS'this movie looks weird so im gonna watch it'
p77
aS'and i loved it'
p78
aS'This movie was pretty strange, but I liked it. The final 30 minutes was \ndamn freaky.'
p79
aS'This was the worst movie ever made!!!'
p80
aS'Somebody said "Species"?'
p81
aS"I was thinking about that, too. The story does not tell who the father is \nbut let's hope she's carrying Clive's baby."
p82
aS'Yes because an opinion is a valid measure for the quality of a movie x3 \nObviously it had a story line, did you actually pay attention or not?'
p83
aS'Looks fucked up. '
p84
aS'Watched it...and it was...WoW!'
p85
aS'it has pretty eyes.'
p86
aS'WTF !!!'
p87
aS'For a sci fi movie they sure ignored alot of basic science'
p88
aS"It wasn't meant to be used as a weapon, I have no clue where you get that \nIdea from. I considered this to have at the very least an interesting \npremise."
p89
aS'Se was really so cute! The movie was great. Except the ending, which was \nbad imao. (after the burial)'
p90
aS"Haven't seen it yet, but there are actually many creatures who can \nwillingly change its gender. Frogs and some reptiles for example."
p91
aS"A great movie with an excellent and tight story line. A modern Frankenstein \nmovie. What was so surprising is how it dealt with the complex issues of \nwhat motivated the scientists to act the way they did. The semi-human \ncharacter was portrayed with an extraordinary boldness and power. This \nshould have been a failure but it wasn't. All kinds of questions are \nbrought up about man playing God in laboratories, mental illness, profit, \nfeminism: almost every issue is intelligently brought up..."
p92
aS"It's kinda bad tho"
p93
aS'Scientists are OPENLY conducting this kind of experiments. Who knows how \nfar they will go? ...but I believe there is no "too far" for them, for in \nthe name of science, they are ready to do atrocities, that exceed the deeds \ndone "in the name of god". This comment will surely not stop those \ncrackers, but I hope, that it will make at least a couple of persons think \nthis over.'
p94
aS"Despite warnings in many Hollywood movies...it's been revealed that British \nscientists ARE cloning human DNA with animal DNA for experimental \npurposes...(And we can be sure it's not only the British!)"
p95
aS'Trust me, it is. '
p96
aS'this wasnt even scary it was weird'
p97
