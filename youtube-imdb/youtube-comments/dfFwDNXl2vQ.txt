S"The movie is good! She's ^ annoying."
p1
aS'Her AI is impressive.\n\nmostly the eyes of the humanoid is focused in this movie rather than her \nmovement fuctions.'
p2
aS'The Purge sucked because it tried to apply human contrivances of \nmachine-like emotions to humans and did a fantastically poor job of it, not \nan easy thing to do, considering that humans are basically machines. Were \nthe villains in that movie clear? Yes? Ok, then it sucks at portraying \nhumans.\n\nNow, of course, I have to get the sexism argument out of the way. This is \nnot a movie about a machine wanting to have sex with a scientist. At no \npoint is that ever insinuated unless you are looking for it. The Machine is \nno more complex than an infant "talk to me, touch me."  And then there\'s \nthe Turing test, where the machine says a child would want the window \ninstead of the puppy.\n\nThe whole point of the plot is that The Machine is learning, as are the AI \nenhanced soldiers who are human and decidedly un-sexy. At some point, just \nlike children, they stop learning from us and start learning for \nthemselves, and that is when things become scary for many. If this movie \nwas designed to be sexy, the end sequence, or any sequence, would have \nfeatured some sort of love scene, and it doesn\'t. It shows a father falling \nbehind as a new generation rises with the sun. The machine wins. And why \nwouldn\'t it? It always has before. Our genes don\'t like it, sure, but the \ngenes they created to replace themselves are not concerned with that. The \nnew replace the old, by wisdom or numbers. Everyone knows that, and yet \neveryone fears it. Great movie fodder.\n\nBut this movie has depth beyond just being a sci-fi story. You can tell by \nhow very little time was spent on the sci-fi elements. Most of the conflict \nin this film is one over human nature and how it applies to The Machine.\n\nThat said, full disclosure, I am a trans-humanist, so maybe I\'m just seeing \nwhat I want to see.  I don\'t say that humans are machines as a metaphor or \nan exaggeration, humans are gene factories. They may ask dumb philosophical \nquestions like "What is love" but the answer is that they are gene \nfactories, some are just less compatible than others because they do not \nproduce more desirable gene factories. The gene only ever wants to make \nmore of itself.\n\nOf course, the answer to what is desirable changes all the time, a result \nof our species constantly being pursued by viruses. For every generation we \nproduce, they make billions, and though they do not adapt the same way we \ndo, just one fucking protein coat mutation can spell death for millions or \nbillions of use because we are so closely-related. We are a human family \nabove all, no matter how we bicker, and our divisiveness is necessary to \nescape our pursuers. People dream of humanity being one race, but that \nwould mean doom, and you need look no further than their desire for \nindividuality to see it. Machines. Programmed, constructed, and I daresay, \nready to execute their functions, especially if they face eradication, or \ndo we not base movies on that? See? Programmed. Machines. \n\nOur constant race to outdo each other is not without its advantages, \nthough. We create ever higher forms of order in our chaos. More resources \nare won with less energy, more of us populate the earth than ever before, \nand our social organization continues to grow no matter how much it wars. \nAt the end of the day, we are all human and humanity will win out over \ninhumanity, as it always has. Some call us a plague, when we are nothing \nbut. We are a scaffolding. Parts fall down, so that better parts arise. We \nare the definition of natural order in ways that those who fancy themselves \nnaturalists could never account for. \n\nWe are the future, but what future will that make? A futile question, best \nreserved for entertainment. Humanity survives one way or another. That is \nour purpose, even if it means our end.'
p3
aS"So would you call this a good independent film or a B-grade? Considering \nbuying the B'Ray"
p4
aS'This slut is fat & ugly as fuck with an annoying as HELL voice!!!!!!!!'
p5
aS'A really good film would have had a man as the Machine.'
p6
aS'Grace, did you notice some of the aesthetic and stylistic similarities with \nBlade Runner?  The rogue blonde robot reminds me a lot of Rutger Hauer, for \nexample. '
p7
aS'Ok seriously, does any scientist on this movies ever remember to put a \nswitch off safety button somewhere?? or a self destruction mechanism? Fuck \noff ."""'
p8
aS"Just saw this movie. It'd decent, special effects suprisingly good for the \nbudget.  "
p9
aS'next part of this movie \nmake it longer ! or else there will be danger :) '
p10
aS"Splice, Species? She didn't watch the movie before making this post \nobviously. The movie was great, a totally different pace and mood than the \nusual US blockbusters. There is nothing kinky about the film...."
p11
aS'I saw this and loved it.. Great story and great effects got a little slow \nin the middle but the end was awesome... loved it'
p12
aS'Dance scene is amazing'
p13
aS'Can someone help me: in what part does the "machine" want sex? I see her \nform attachment, and I see her show obsession and I see her naked. But I \nthink it\'s projecting what we as human see when we see obsession from a \nnaked female form and think it equals sex. isn\'t she new AI? It doesn\'t \nseem she knows what she wants at first, but gets more militant about \ngetting it.'
p14
aS"It was an amazing movie Caity Lotz is a fantastic actress, and really the \ntrailer is quite misleading the machine isn't even the villain in the \nmovie, and there is no robot on human action."
p15
aS"the trailer for this movie is extremely misleading, dialogue and scenes out \nof context, the machine isn't crazy or even the bady of the movie, yet the \ntrailer is cut that way, its not horror either"
p16
aS"In my book it beat out most AI movies even though it was a simple movie, \nbut it captured what makes an AI movies interesting.  That is Human and AI \nrelationship.  Best AI movie I've seen in a long time.  Loved it!!!  \nOrdered my blue ray copy.  Best $13 dollars I've spent on a movie in a long \ntime.  Can't wait for a sequel since the Terminator franchise is dead.   \nWhat Beyond the Trailer????  Sexual harassment???  There is no kinky to \nthis movie, but if there was I would have  supported it.  Why not, the \nmachine was learning in it's innocence and it would have be part of \nemotional growth.    Regardless, it excellent film making for sure. "
p17
aS'once the trailer ended and the girl showed up, i thought she was a machine \ntoo, seriously lol'
p18
aS'omg this shit aint worth the bandwidth'
p19
aS"Reminds me of Blade Runner even the music sounds like it :) If they build \nrobots like her dammmm I wonder if they pass laws that lets you marry a \nmachine? I didn't see the big deal they let same sex marriages now days \nso we should be aloud to marry our computer hehehe"
p20
aS'She had a dream.'
p21
aS'i can say that the story line is not original and the acting not very good \nether.'
p22
aS'isnt that sarah lance from arrow?'
p23
aS'Just wanna see, I am pretty excited for a "the machine xxx" movie...'
p24
aS'This film was shockingly not Kinky, I mean they cut a woman out of a latex \nskin suit and somehow made it not sexy. then the titular character spends \nthe rest of the film exhibiting virtually complete asexuality.'
p25
aS'fuck mr wong\nthis was shit\nrobocop with panties'
p26
aS'This trailer remind me to spliced'
p27
aS'What\'s turning me off this is the tired "Technology is evil!" plot. We see \nso few good guy, or even just non-psycho, robots that this kind of feels \nlike a missed oportunity.\n...I\'ll probably still go see it though.\n\nI haven\'t seen Almost Human yet.\n\nAnyway, I love these videos. They are how I hear about most of the new \nmovies coming out. Thanks Grace. ^_^'

p43
aS'meh'
p44
aS'hey.. i saw the movie recently.... i loved it... btw.. i think it touches \nme more.. cause i know. most teens n people want to just have fun... i know \nthis is the future... like many sifi authors have said.. and also some of \nmy thoughts of the future... it touches me.. cause i know, its a treath.. \nthe human race spends (yes today. right now) trillions of dollars on \nmilitary technology. IT tells us about ourselves. we want to fight each \nother. this might be close. btw this was not horror. it was thriller.. and \ni know, the human race is lost... this will be a possible future, unless, \nwe really decide, what we want to do in life...'
p45
aS"This film is excellent.  I loved its claustrophobic feel.  Yes, there is a \nsense of the familiar (the Blade Runner, Vangelis-esque overture for \nexample) but there are still some nice surprises in there.  \n\nNo, the film is NOT about the protagonist spending billions of pounds of \ntax payers' money just to create a machine that he can shag.  Heaven forbid!\n\nBottom line, it's all been down hill since, Mary Shelley's, Frankenstein \nbut this is still definitely one to watch. "
p46
aS'No let have the machine bi sexual ok so the machine take turns blowing you \npeople fair enough'
p47
aS'This was a pretty damn good movie. I didn\'t find anything kinky about the \nmovie in fact I thought the connection between the machine and it\'s creator \nbrought an element of humanity to the film. The acting was very good, \nparticularly the lead female role "the machine". Although I did find that \nthe plot has been done before, with a fresh take. Overall quite \nentertaining, worth a watch.'

aS'Can you please do a review on "her" thank you'
p68
aS"Uhmmm. It's like Splice gone Tech. :|"
p69
aS'I like when they at least address it because there is this "perfect" being \nright in front of you that is usually the only one of its kind. So \naesthetically the human is likely to at least notice them sexually and the \ncreation is obviously going to want to connect to others in any way \npossible. But I also think they should address the fact that if it is the \ncreator that the robot focuses its affections on, there is that sudden \nrealization that this being while advanced is still often little more than \na child in real world experience and is your progeny (intellectually if not \nactually physically). I realized that with that episode in Star Trek where \nMr. Evergreen created a robot to serve as a companion but never seemed to \nrealize that if she had functioned in the way he hoped her to, he would \nhave technically been in a relationship with his own daughter who was \nspecifically "born" for that (which always seemed a little rapey and sick \nto me though understood how lonely he must have been).'

aS"Typical! They do a super-duper robot, and instead of doing something \nproductive for humanity with it, they put a kick ass out the bad guys. I \nthink I'll see that"
p82
aS'Just recently the scientists working at the cutting edge of Nano materials \ndeveloped a new metal alloy, which behaves like muscle and can perform 1000 \ntimes the power of human muscle cell, which has been calculated to be 10 \ntimes of the electric motor power. There are since the late 80s hundreds of \nscientists, who are working since many years on different AI projects. Just \nthe mere fact.'
