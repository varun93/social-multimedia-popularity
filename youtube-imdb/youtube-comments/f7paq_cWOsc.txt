S'I really dont get this one thing about the movie, did he travel from \nanother world A I is he an alien or did he fall threw time to the viking \nage?'
p1
aS'this movie was awsome,one of my favorites'
p2
aS'Vikings! But please learn Danish'
p3
aS"Don't write HD if it's not HD ! \n\noh and can't really see anything! bad upload"
p4
aS'the trailer gives everything away lol'
p5
aS'Good move, i liked it much more than Prometheus ;)'
p6
aS"This movie is actually REALLY good. It just didn't make a lot of money."
p7
aS"This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life! Vikings vs aliens? Who \nwins? My thought was aliens, beacose vikings can't stand a chanse against \naliens defenatlly not predators! :D But this movie rocked so hard it feels \nlike I want to whatch it again and agian! :) "
p8
aS'i just Saw" FROM Lord of the Ring" .. so i watched it '
p9
aS'vikings and aliens? lol'
p10
aS"Movie was amazing! Just watched it; one of the few movies on SyFy that \nentertain and didn't have a $100 budget."
p11
aS"SO let me get this straight. Jesus plays a space marine who lands on earth \nduring the time of vikings and teams up with them to fight a space dragon? \nAnd Ron Perlman's in it too? Okay, this is quite possibly the most metal \nmovie I've ever seen."
p12
aS'wat?'
p13
aS'Almost seems like a dramatic, pseudo-retelling of "Army of Darkness". I may \nhave to check this one out.'
p14
aS"Weird that they put some modern guy with weapons in it. It doesn't fit in \nthe Viking style. Great movie though"
p15
aS'Ah, buy into the premise for a couple hours. It\'s worth a couple hours of \nyour time. Think of it as "Hunter Prey" on steroids, and with more than \nhalf a dozen people in the cast. This ain\'t Shakespeare, folks. It wasn\'t \nmeant to be. It\'s entertainment. Grab your favorite drink and snack and \nrelax for a bit.'
p16
aS'Epic movie, I enjoyed every minute of it! '
p17
aS'@GentlemanofWolves Sounds like something done by Immediate Music. They do a \nlot of trailer work.'
p18
aS'Ended up looking closer to Skyrim. Needs more fus do rah but. '
p19
aS'Yeah I caught that one too'
p20
aS'A very nice reworking of the Beowulf myth.'
p21
aS'Mass Effect and Skyrim.. '
p22
aS"BEST ! My Favorite. I'm waiting for Outlander 2"
p23
aS"it's like Skyrim main quest"
p24
aS'Wow, the song at the endis from lord of the rings. It is still Peter \nJackson but they could have other soundtrack'
p25
aS'@zabbot93 What are you talking about the vikings belong to Sweden? The \nmajority of the vikings came from Norway! I agree though, the movie was \ngreat ;D'
p26
aS"I never saw the trailer until now. didn't even know it existed! I just \nended up finding it on Netflix. Great movie, but I found it hard to follow."
p27
aS'Great movie...=)'
p28
aS'Does "HD" stand for "Flag for misleading text"? I think that\'s what it \nmeans.'
p29
aS"It involves vikings, fjords, Norway (supposedly)... I have to watch it just \nfor that reason alone, but the creature makes it even more of a must-see. \nEven if it's a bit silly they all speak English, it does look interesting."
p30
aS'well now that i saw the last scene; seemed good.'
p31
aS'this movie is really good, you will be amazed, i was'
p32
aS'If there ever is a Mass Effect movie they should get James Caviezel to play \nShepard. He can pass as him as well as that shot at 0:20 and at 1:02 gave \nme huge mass effect vibes. Anyway this movie pretty good.'
p33
aS'@drewcuadra yeah you even have a king ulfric or however you spell it'
p34
aS'whats the music ???'
p35
aS'No this is MARS!'
p36
aS'Typical movie makers bogus, the space dude with super sofisticated weapon, \nthat he looses, and then the crude Vikings. I really wonder where these nut \njobs get the bit about the clothing with the incredibly crude stiching, \nusing a "thread" normal people would use for hanging their laundry on. Also \ngrand lots of tatoos and bald heads...hmm lets see in early medieval times \npeoples heads where shaved as a symbol of shame, and the tatoos, did they \nhave contact with the Maori?? Amazing!! Crap!'
p37
aS"Wow, you couldn't be more wrong there, infacts brits were under the Romans, \nuntil the saxons came and pushed them away, when the brits fought back and \nmade them flee, then the vikings came and raided the country, and when i \nsay Vikings i mean, Danish, Norwegian & Swedes, then the Viking cnut the \ngreat becomes king, then again the Brits fought back and won, but almost \nthe same year, there was invaders from france aka normans, a man actually \nfrom norway, so no, norwegians was never brits."
p38
aS"One of the best sci fi films I've seen."
p39
aS'I demand that this movie have the same respect as demolition man an the \nfifth element. This is a great movie, it is certainly a little predictable \nand not historically accurate. But hot damn it is a fun thing to watch this \nis the type of movie that should be on television constantly, it is just a \nfun ride from start to finish.'
p40
aS'This movie is sooo sad! I was on the side of the monster the whole time! \nEvil humans came and destroyed their world and killed their children. I \nwould be pissed as hell, too :D'

p48
aS'wow, lol, that comment made me crack up so much. Especially the use of the \nword "metal" as a generic adjective. This movie is pretty extreme. Very \nwell done for an indi film.'
p49
aS'@Zeetana "It involves Norway and Fjords" More like a shit ton of green \nscreens. '
p50
aS'@cayetanoluis i think this was a DVD release 2 in 2008.'
p51
aS"This trailer looks fantastic! I am very eager to see this movie. I've \nalways liked Caviezel's work, and genre meshing usually grabs my interest."
p52
aS"haha You obviously don't understand what he meant. He was trying to say \nthat the accents in the movie are British you muppet "
p53
aS'THE. BEST. SERIES. EVERRRRRR!'

aS'Wealth beyond measure outlander'
p66
aS"The director chose for Kainan to speak an alien language before adapting to \nthe Vikings' language, which would be spoken in English for film audiences' \nsake. Old Norse was the alien language selected for Kainan to speak, and \nJames Caviezel was trained to speak the language by a linguistics professor \nfrom Iceland. "

p74
aS'They should speak "dnsk tunga" which means "Danish tongue". That was the \nlanguage of the vikings.'
p75
aS'This is a GREAT MOVIE!'
p76
aS'ohh how nice HD quality...'
p77
aS"Me and my mother saw it yesterday on demand. It was ok. The action was \ngood, the effects were good, even the story and plot are good. The acting \nis a little silly but enjoyable. It has the same feel from cowboys and \naliens. Still it wasn't excellent but it certainly wasn't horrible. it was \njust ok. :)"
p78
aS'Beowolf with a sci-fi twist. This could have ended up a bad movie is so \nmany ways. But it is actually pretty good. All the characters are \nbelievable, nice effects (the beast) and enterresting backstory.'
p79

p92
aS'thumbs up if its 2011 and its 1st time u see the trailer!!! LOL.'
p93
aS"slightly disappointed. Only about 10 minutes worth of Space marine footage \nand action. The rest is a bunch of Norwegians fighting with swords. I \nexpected more fire power and clashing between vikings and space marines. \nDoesn't happen... B+ for story line, C+ for writing, B for acting, over all \nC- for failing to meet my expectations of a kick ass space battle taking \nplace in Norway. "
p94
aS"vikings and aliens, cowboys and aliens... what's next? spartans and aliens \nTHIS IS SPARTAAAAA"
p95
aS"Hi viking-lovers. I haven't seen this movie, but i want to. And i know, \nvikings aren't swedish or danish. Vikings are vikings. They were Old Norse \npeoples, and from ON people, they became Vikins. But from On people, became \nnot just vikings, but Faroese, Anglo-Saxon, Old Germanic,too. ON was the \ngreat past of these. Look for it on wikipedia...."
