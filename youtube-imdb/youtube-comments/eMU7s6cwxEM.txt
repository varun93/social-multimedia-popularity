aS'I remember when I was sixteen after seeing the movie Dirty Dancing I \ndecided I wanted to be a Chippendales dancer when I grew up. Patrick Swayze \nhad the most sexy moves, and he really inspired me to dance / strip. I got \nhome after seeing the movie and put on the Dirty Dancing soundtrack. I had \nto practice my moves in the shower so my Mom wouldn\'t know what I was up \ntoo. I had the time of my life was blasting out of my boom box, and just as \nI screamed "Nobody puts baby in a corner!" I slipped on a bar of soap and \nwent face first through the glass door! My nose was broken in three places, \nand I had two deep lacerations on my left buttock. My Mom heard me \nscreaming and kicked open the door only to see me bloodied and naked. She \nyelled "Nobody may be putting baby into any corner, but I am putting you in \nthe car to go to the emergency room!" Long story short, I am still not a \nChippendales dancer, and my Mom made me pay for all the damage to the \nbathroom out of my chore money! : ('
