p2
aS'This movie looks stupid. wonder wat this whores dads thinking right now'
p3
aS'how insteresting...a porn video that is supposed to be "sophisticated" and \n"for intellectuals". I see no difference compared to a brazzers video \nfucking hipsters.'
p4
aS"The movie is quite boring.\n     LOTS of mental masturbation, like non artists trying hard to make art \n - and it's just drab.  "
p5
aS"Idk why people are hating on Shia I think he's a fantastic actor and yes \nI've seen more then the transformers. "
p6
aS"Son of Indiana Jones is having a penis, wow!? The scene with Uma Turman was \nthe finniest one, I couldn't stop laughing.\n\nBut seriously, we give too much importance to genitals without actually \nunderstanding what genitals are and what's going on, so I'm going to \nenlighten you.\n\nWe evolved over extremely long period of time in a very violent \nenvironment. Like we tend to fight between each other, at least we did in \nthe past, when the system was less ordered, the same is happening on a \ncellular level, just more intense. So, our cells found a way to protect \nthemselves better from attack of other microorganisms. And as centuries \nwere passing less effective solutions died off. Eventually cells came up \nwith a more effective way of bypassing and eliminating hostile \nmicroorganisms. That's when genitals came along. You see, the genitals \nbypass all the outside microorganisms in more than one way. The vagina is \nfar from sterile, there are colonies of bacterias, fungus, viruses and \nwhatnot there, even inside, multiplying all the time, having their form of \nsex. Now, when the friction is repeated between penis and vagina, all those \ncolonies go through their form of earthquakes. Most of them, if not all, \nare eliminated, giving a better chance to our microorganisms to succeed. \nThe ejaculation is yet another way of bypassing the remainder of alive \ncolonies of hostile microorganisms. If a male can ejaculate with great \nstrength, chances are even greater.\n\nThe process is not yet perfect and will be most likely changed or switched \ninto something better, so there are failures. We already have people with \nboth genitals, that could mean a step forward. Though the society is not \naccepting those individuals yet, the nature might, as time passes. People \nwith both genitals might form a new type of genital of some sort with self \nreplication properties, but none of us alive right now will be a witness to \nthat, we're talking thousands of years of gradual evolution.\n\nSometimes these hostile microorganisms, around us, genitals and inside \nvagina, get along with the sperm into the egg cell and the child gets born \nfaulty, some even get cancer later on or other forms of disorders and \nimmune problems.\n\nAs you can see it's not about love at all, it's about war, killing and \nsurvival of the fittest."
p7
aS'Be sure to watch Dogville and Antichrist.  They are classics.  Von Trier \ntakes it to another level.'
p8
aS'I watched it and I don\'t get the part where she says, "I don\'t feel \nanything" is she implying that Shia\'s dick was small '

aS'GET OFF THE FUCKING STAGE, SHIA!'
p14
aS"I actually like the movie it's daring for the director and appeals to a \ncertain audience "
p15
aS"Look at all these butthurt people hating. Hypersexuality is a mental \ndisease. And non-terminal diseases make people interesting, for what \ngreater victory than being more an invisible force in your own body that \nholds your life back. And you can't handle that thought, you are boring \nanyway in real life. Also in this case you are jealous that she gets to \nhave endless sex and you don't( you horny little toad!), if you do you are \nafraid of getting social labels but she won't because she is technically \nill. You don't even hate this movie you hate how she(the character) has \nsomething you can never have, in other words you are envious of a sick \nperson. And you get the scumbag label,sir."

p48
aS'visto Nymphomaniac vol. I\nvoto: bellissimo e da vedere almeno un paio di volte.\n terribilmente dostoevskijano e bergmanniano. dialoghi strepitosi. c\' \nanche la battuta cameo sull\'antisemitismo!\ne tutto quell\'amore, paterno, sessuale, amicale bistrattato nel nome \ndell\'essere carne, ma non solo.\nsvariate le inquadrature da ricordare. "mi sono bagnata", con la goccia di \numore che netta, scivolando, la sfocatura della morte del padre,  la mia \npreferita.\n la mocciosa  ammirevole da molti punti di vista.\nda gulp & slurp anche la soundtrack che spazia dai Rammestein a Saint-Sans.\n\nA mio parere lui  la prossima vittima e il film  tutta una sciarada di \ncaccia.'
p49
aS'Not gonna lie, looks horrible, but I might be wrong'

aS'SONG: RAMMSTEIN - FUHRE MICH'
p61
aS"this is one of the best movies i have EVER seen, it left me speechless and \nit's so fucking sad that people don't appreciate the meaning behind it"
p62
aS'better to type youporn than watch that movie..'
p63
aS"I am really shocked from Shia this is the disgastig thing I have ever seen \nin my life I meen why Shia do this bad film and he had a very festeval \nhistory of sucssesaful films in the past Shia was my fav. actor but I \ndidn't think that will still Now and Shia will lose a big amount of his \nLovers I am so really sad for that I hope they don't make (volume II)"
p64
aS'I am SO in love with this movie! Ughhh!'
p65
aS"In my opinion,the Rammstein song ''Pussy'' was more suitable for this movie \nthan ''Fuhre Mich''. "
p66
aS'Pues me pareci aburrida, pretenciosa y lenta'
p67
aS'Rammstein '
p68

p82
aS'Maybe this will be the second pornography film to be nominated to Oscars if \nthey will be given a chance to be.. :)'
p83
aS'Pretty disappointed in this movie. You think its going to be a very erotic \nsensual movie but is really overrun by philosophical dialogue and two \npeople making random intellectual comparisons with the experiences of one \nwoman\'s wandering lusts. This movie is more in the line of the  animation \nfilm "Waking life" if you liked that movie I\'m sure you\'ll like this as \nwell.  '
p84
aS'zzzzzzzz.........vol. 1?\nreally..,\nlets all have a nice big yawn.................'
p85
aS'one of the most disturbing movies i have ever seen'
p86
aS' This film will largely be judged for its extremely graphic sex scenes and \ndescriptive dialog. It is primarily a conversation between a self-described \nnymphomaniac and a good Samaritan who offers her his hospitality in the \nopening scene. As she describes her life, he overlays his rather \nsophisticated views about what drives her purported pathology- however, as \nthe story evolves she is humanized: a character struggling- not necessarily \na victim, but rather someone relatable- yet living on the ostracized \nfringe. Many people will see this film as porn; it is not. It is \nhyperactive sexuality and insight brilliantly captured, but yet offensive \nto many.'
p87
aS'Worst ending to a movie ever. Ruins the whole thing and makes zero sense.'
p88
aS"So eh yeah I only came here for Rammstein. :'D"
p89
aS'Why were some parts in a different aspect ratio?'
p90
aS'people dont realize how fucked up this movie is '
p91
aS'only skinny girls have nympho.... so fat lady.. be cool...HAHAAH'
