aS'The Love Punch Official UK Trailer #1 (2014) - Emma Thompson, Pierce \nBrosnan Movie HD'
p25
aS"Emma Thompson and Pierce Brosnan star as bickering/flirty exes who rope \ntheir neighbours (Celia Imrie and Timothy Spall) into a plot to steal a \ndiamond from a dastardly businessman. The story is mediocre and the main \nactors cannot sell their characters - they are not funny. However, the \nneighbours are brilliant and are the most interesting characters in the \nmovie - they also have a mysterious back story which is more exciting than \nthe actual story.\n\nThe good:\n\n- Pierce Brosnan poking fun at his James Bond image, most notably during a \nclifftop-scaling scene where it turns out he's afraid of heights.\n \n- The chemistry between Pierce Brosnan and Emma Thomson's characters.\n\n- The neighbours!!!\n\nThe bad:\n\n- Unbelievable story. This movie is not memorable at all.\n\n- Emma Thomson's character attending a hen party.\n\n- The awful cliches - people allergic to cats and flowers will sneeze at \nthe most inappropriate time.\n\nThis movie would have been awesome as a TV movie. It's bad."
