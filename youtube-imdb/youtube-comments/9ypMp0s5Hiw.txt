S"I must say Jewish people were too peaceful even during the war. How the \nfuck was moving few hundreds Jewish prisoners to a gas chamber possible by \nonly few german soldiers ? Because they had guns? Why they did not fight \nback all together? I just don't fucking get it.  Will someone explain this \nto me? I am so mad every time i think about people killing innocents during \na war. If they knew they were gonna die anyway then why not die trying to \nfight back??"
p1
aS"This film was ridiculous. In the end, the audience are meant to feel \nsympathy for a family of Nazis pretending to be normal people. Obviously \nthe kid didn't deserve to be gassed to death, but it's still badly written."
p2
aS"I'm American , what were the American doing when this was happening? I \nhaven't been taught much on this matter (I'm 13) I'm sure we did something \nto help.?"
p3
aS"Wow.. This movie is a huge eye opener, and I mean huge! It really makes me \nthink about how much shit I take for granted when I shouldn't. Everything \ncould be a lot worse, for each and every one of us but instead were either \nsitting on our computers or phones and talking shit to one another for our \nopinions on the whole thing, on a trailer for a movie. Some should actually \nwatch it and take a lesson from it because I know I did. They did an \namazing job with this movie. I hope Hitler's burning alive at this very \nsecond crying for help.. Son of a bitch. What bothers me is he took the \neasy way out and committed suicide before anyone could get a hold of him \nand torture him, only for the simple fact that he's a little bitch. This \nmovie made me ball my eyes out. I cannot believe that good souls and good \nhearted people had their lives swiped from right under them so instantly \nlike that, after slaving for half their lives, and then having no choice \nbut to be assassinated. We do have the choice in today's world. So please \npeople, stop bitching to one another about this and that. Let's all be one \nand think about what we can fix in this world and go from there. We can \nmake the world better if we really wanted.. Each one of us have the choice. \n** Oh and please excuse my foul language but this is a very touching movie \nand it really has me all bothered."

aS"*Guess who's back*\n\nAfter a few days not being online I am back. I had 2 wonderfull days. I saw \nSelby win the wolrdmaster title of snooker, I had a great day yesterday \nwith some friends. and I saw a really impressive movie.\nI am not the kind a guy that gets really emotional by watching movies, but \nthis one makes me laugh, cry and gives me shivers all over now and then. It \ntells the story about 2 boys that had a forbidden friendship during the war.\n\nI hope you all had wonderful days as well!\n\n#movie  #theboywiththestripedpyjamas."

aS"I just finished watching this movie. When it was close the end, my \nheartbeats raised abnormally out of the thrilling curiosity and within \nminutes my heart sank. This is a beautiful tragic movie, indeed.\nIt shows the friendship between two 8-year-olds. And how many kinds of \nlives, innocent or not had to face the consequences they did not deserve. \nIt shows a big example of karma. I'd definitely recommend this movie to \nyou! \n\nP.S: It's high time our morality should wake up. Pray for all those people \ntrapped in places having wars and are facing painful consequences that were \nnever supposed to be in their fate."

aS'The past is painful...\nAfter this movie I realized once again that in this year is much better \nlife even we complain that there is no money. Pianist another wonderful \nfilm showed me some incredible disturbing pictures.I think that racism was \none of the most tragic groups most inhumane attitudes and practices. \nThe message is one that should be welcomed by all. We are all human and no \nmatter color or nation, what matters is that we are  humans and we have a \nsoul.\nIt is our choice whom to spend time but it is unacceptable to kill someone \njust because he is a Jew or a Gypsy.'

aS'Is Remus Lupin the Commandant!? WHOA.'
p89
aS"I read about the ending somewhere and WOW like that is really \nintense....and just beyond sick that things like that actually happened. I \nalso read a book for my class about the holocaust and just balled like \ncrazy. Along with the movie 12 years a slave I'm just in awe that these \nthings happened to people just for the sake of power and having control. \nYou hear in text books all the time about tragedy like this but once you \nsee everything in detail and color it paints a whole different picture."
