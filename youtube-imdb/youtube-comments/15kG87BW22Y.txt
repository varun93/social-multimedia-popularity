S'I thought it was pretty good, not particularly memorable but still \nenjoyable.. Standard story of a woman who gets her heart broken but her \nreal problem is her narcissism, just with a Going Green/Indie  vibe to it.'
p1
aS"Daryl Wein is a genius. I am a 28 year old African American woman, \ncompletely relate to this trailer and cannot wait to see it. He's good. So \nis Greta :-)"
p2
aS'Good movie'
p3
aS"really great movie.. I'm becoming a fan of Greta Gerwig. I'm definitely \nwatching Frances Ha again. :) "
p4
aS'loved the movie!!!'
p5
aS'Go Outside by the Cults. I love that song.'
p6
aS'In other words: it looks cute. 500 Days of Summer was adorable and gave me \nsome good laughs, I hope this one does the same.'
p7
aS'What song is at the end?'
p8
aS'so true!'
p9
aS'4 thumbs low thank you'
p10
aS'lol why though?'
p11
aS'It is a stupid movie,Godd!is boring!the thrailer is very good! !'
p12
aS'Shes right. Im obsessed with Cinderella when I was growing up. Thats why I \nlove shoes since I was a little girl'
p13
aS'Actually, yes (a small one). : )'
p14
aS'this looks pretty funny....I like the boozing through the street on a \nweekday and getting removed from the stripper stage parts :P'
p15
aS'What\'s the name of the middle song? After "Go Outside" by the Cults'
p16
aS'"comment no longer exists" NOOOOOOOOOOOO'
p17

p22
aS'um noo? she says remember how much i loved cinderella?'
p23
aS'I did the same thing before I saw your comment! Strange! '
p24
aS'for the idiots trashing this movie, maybe you could say WHY you dislike it \ninstead of leaving nonconstructive criticism of hate'
p25
aS'Is anyone else concerned about this hipster culture that seems to be \ndominating Hollywood and the movie industry now a days? Hipsters are \nfaux-artists. They dress like artist, but they don\'t know real art. They \ndon\'t make real art. Movies like this seem very forced and insincere. It\'s \nquirky for the sake of quirky. It\'s really obnoxious. I\'m getting sick of \nmovies like this, or how about that new HBO show "Girls". Or the TV Show \n"New Girl". What ever happened to real people? Genuine art?'
p26
aS'fucking dippy'
p27
aS"I'm sorry but you completely missed the point of my comment, I feel as if \nyou didn't even read it. No, I'm not worried that art is too mainstream \nnow. I have no problem with art being mainstream. That seems like a problem \na hipster would have. I'm sorry, but I refuse to just sit down and be quiet \nwhile the quality of film and television is tarnished by this horrible new \ntrend. Portland? Yikes! Good luck with that."
p28
aS'LOVE THIS MOVIE! '
p29
aS'Love this movie'
p30
aS'loved this movie! Hilarious, heartfelt, honest... and realistic.'
p31
aS'hipster shieth also the bf left her for summer from 500 days of summer '
p32
aS'Anybody know the song at the end?'
p33
aS"-Remember how much I loved Cinderella? -It's a classic. -It's what messes \nlittle girls up. We all get obsessed with shoes. (thought this was \nhilarious.)"
p34
aS'exactly what i thought!'
p35
aS'No more original films'
p36
aS'awful. ...god awful. this is the only movie that made me want to inject \nacid in my veins.'
p37
aS'i thought the same thing! Also kind of thought she wasnt pretty enough to \nbe a leading lady. dont think she fit well. '
p38
aS"I'm kind of glad I saw the trailer before going to watch this movie. It \nlooks really depressing to me for some reason..."
p39
aS'sometimes she looks like brittany murphy'
p40
aS'The cults - outside '

p46
aS'looking forward to ittttttt'
p47
aS'such a crappy movie! awkward and pointless.'
p48
aS'I like Daryl Weins movies. His other one, Breaking Upwards, i really \nenjoyed. This one was decent as well. Its pretty realistic & relatable to \nboth men & women relationship experiences with corting, dating, & breakups.'
p49
aS'I hope the Kinks song of the same name is in this movie. '
p50
aS'Is this a sequel to Run Lola Run?'
p51
aS'Almost puked when she\'s chanting "it\'s a wedding dress!" over and over. \nMore vapid marriage propaganda aimed at a demographic of navel-gazing, \nself-absorbed, privileged white assholes. I\'m so sick of films wherein \nwomen are "projects" who are constantly working on themselves and whose \nlives revolve around the search for a man, coupled with an exaggerated \npreoccupation with shoes. Besides, she\'s 30 years old, for god\'s sake. \nShe\'s a baby, a whiny pathetic little baby we\'ve seen 100 times before.'
p52
aS'My Body - Young the Giant'
p53
aS'Young The Giant'
p54
aS'Reppar Sverige!'
p55
aS'Looks good, but I want Zoe to be the lead.'
p56
aS"What makes this movie hipster? Can someone enlighten me? I can't tell the \ndifference anymore. Is it just the mismatched clothing, or the presence of \nparticular actors and music that create a hipster aesthetic?"
p57
aS'When it says "From the studio that brought you 500 Days of Summer" it\'s \npretty clear that indie filmmaking is now a marketing tool.'
p58
aS'The trailer looked good The movie was garbage, not funny at all. Dont waste \nyour bandwidth on it'
p59
aS'song at the start: cults - go outside. song at the end: young the giant - \nmy body'
p60
aS'Joel Kinnaman <3 '
p61
aS'this movie was awesome.'
p62
aS'Yo'
p63
aS'"Honey what\'s up! did u just had a stroke?"'
p64
aS'Ufffff como que no me gusta mucho'
p65
aS'awsome !!!! i saw that somewhere ... me ! : x'
p66
aS'Jjajahaha'
p67
aS'hahahha uuuups I meant 1:31 :)'
p68
aS'omg, this looks so good!'
p69
aS'no one needs to be "pretty" for a lead role. the notion that someone has to \nbe attractive or famous enough for a lead role is ridiculous'
p70
aS'Holy Shit, the more I look at her she reminds me of Brittany Murphy. Her \nlittle expressions are very similar. '
p71
aS'NEW YORK!!! I love this city'
p72
aS'the bouncer says "get off the stage"'
p73
aS'lol why?'
p74
aS'why is everyone fucking ugly in this movie?'
p75
aS'whats the name of the song at beginning?'
p76
aS'i really thought this movie would be more inspirational but she just kept \nfrustrating me with her actions and i kept waiting for her to turn things \naround a lot sooner :/'
p77
aS'friendzoned before it was cool... or is he gay?'
p78
aS'Loveee it :D'
p79
aS'did she just say "jag mste spy" (I have vomit) at the part 1:33 ??? :O '
p80
aS'Soon as she said "Men are always looking for someone better and women are \njust looking for whatever works". I paused the video, wrote this comment \nand now I\'m closing the tab.'
p81
aS"Same studio... does that mean same creators, same director, same writers... \nI don't think so, does it?"
p82
aS'I\'ve just watched the last episode, and "Yo..you\'re my ride Linden"....... \nJoel is my ride.'
p83
aS'@tnz77 actually, this movie epitomizes everything I hate about what \nbrooklyn is becoming.'
p84
aS"Awesome, another movie to fuck up the mindset of females about what is \nimportant and what isn't."
p85
aS'I hear the soundtrack is very good.'
p86
aS'only reason to watch this movie JOEL KINNAMAN <3'
p87
aS'they should replace lola with like leighton meister or something...'
p88
aS'yeh just what i was thinking too R.I.P Brittany'
p89
aS'No Lyndsy Fonseca, this looks like shit...'
p90
aS'Here for him too !!'
p91
aS'I find myself really excited for this mostly due to the fact that I love \nGreta Gerwig. I hope to see it become a bit of a sleeper this summer. '
p92
aS'You seem delightful.'
p93
aS'This looks like it\'s going to be a great, authentic NY comedy. We rarely \nsee funny portraits of single women, post-break up, that feel honest and \nwitty at the same time. Anyone who saw Wein and Lister-Jones\' last film, \n"Breaking Upwards," know they are amazing, young American filmmakers who \nare finally injecting some truth into a dead genre. Kudos to them for \nentering the mainstream with their spirit intact. Can\'t wait to see this \nfilm.'
p94
aS'YOUNG THE GIANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!'
p95
aS'At a certain age women tend to get desperate its when they feel old. So \nwhat she said is partially true cuz she felt desperate only wrong part is \nthat she generalized ..'
p96
aS'I think people get mad at these movies for showing "vapid marriage \npropaganda aimed at a demographic of navel-gazing, self-absorbed, \nprivileged white assholes." But if you look at real life...woman are \nconstantly working on themselves and life for a lot of people does revolve \naround looking for that one person. And c\'mon, the majority (I\'ll admit not \nall) women are sliiightly obsessed with shoes. I\'m not saying that what \nthese kinds of movies show is right...but often what they show is true.'
