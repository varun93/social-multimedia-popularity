S"Is this film any good? I've read the book and it's brilliant.. I just don't \nwant to waste my time on a movie that completely ruins it.. it'd be nice to \nwatch an adaptation, though"
p1
aS'Thats is awful, i injoyed the book alot more, and i would pick the book \ninstead of that. This makes the book look gay, and i hope someone makes the \nmovie that has more talent.'
p2
aS'GOOD I LIKE THIEF.'
p3
aS'I watched this in the cinema with school and I literally cried a river of \ntears '
p4
aS'The narration ruins the trailer though in my opinion. But the movie is much \nbetter than that would represent.'
p5
aS"@William I'll never understand people like you. There is more than enough \nproof that the Holocaust was real. Photos, videos, documents, interviews. \nJust because you weren't there to see it first hand doesn't mean it never \nhappened. What more do you people need to be convinced?!"
p6
aS'This movie is amazing, but trust me, the book is better!'
p7
aS"What's up with the accents?"
p8
aS'WHY DOES THAT BOOK HAVE TO BE SO LONG AND SAD?? CAN SOMEONE TELL ME? WHY?'
p9
aS'I loved this movie!'
p10
aS'I cried so much watching this'
p11
aS"Hmmm after I read the book I gotta say: there is no comparisson... The \nmovie is good but the book captivates you during the second half (the first \nbored me a bit). My favorite character is Rosa, I cried when I read every \nline about her at the end, she was first a meh character to me but then I \nstarted loving her, then my second fav. character is Rudy, which to me \nshows the mind of a kid, how tender it is... Stories that involve kids in \nthis kind of stories always make me feel sad and happy at the same time :/. \nThen Ilsa, full of mistery and attractive but such a sad story behind her, \nand at the end the father, Liesel and Max I always kept them like in the \nsame line, not to attractive but sometimes they had their moments xD... I \ndon't say the movie is bad, but if you have the oportunity to read the \nbook, do it. "
p12
aS'LOVE THIS MOVIE!'
p13
aS"I just watched the movie and seriously, I'm probably the most unemotional \ncreature where I live but at that ending I cried for like 10 minutes \nstraight :'("
p14
aS'Just watched this movie and I actually got choked up still am.. Amazing \nfilm I am a grown man and this brought a tear to my eye.. AMAZING film just \nmake sure you bring tissues and lots of them..'
p15
aS'The Book Thief Trailer!!!!'
p16
aS"Book snobs need to STFU. I am a book and movie lover and yes some books are \nbetter than the movies but for everyone's sake just STFU.  Stop being so \nhigh and mighty and just keep your snob comments to yourselves. Secondly, \nif you want to watch it for free, do some searching and don't  visit the BS \nlinks posted in the comments. People don't post the sites on public forums \nfor a reason. "
p17
aS"I love this movie, ever since I watched I couldn't get it out of my head. \nIts a really good movie, im going to start reading the book soon. "
p18
aS"I just finished this book and can't wait to watch it! One of my favorite \nbooks I have ever read. I hope to write a review of this on my blog soon!"
p19
aS'im reading the book theif right now  AMAZZING :DDDD LOVED IT '
p20
aS'THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL MOVIE PLEASE EVERYONE WATCH IT '
p21
aS'I was considering watching at the theaters, but I felt that it was a bit \ntoo limited in the scope of the events of the book. To think that the scene \nthat got the most attention related to resisting the Nazis was the kids \nshouting I hate Hitler was a bit disappointing. I can always get in dvd \n later on I suppose. Spoiling that the characters die in the narration is a \nturn off for me, I prefer for a similar story The Boy In The Stripped \nPajamas which ending is super powerful.'
p22
aS'HURRDURR BOOK IS BETR '
p23
aS"I'm sorry this movie is good but the book was more rich in detail"
p24
aS'Anyone know a horror film about an adoptive girl that tries to kill \neveryone?'

p27
aS'Another film perpetuating the Holocoust lie...'
p28
aS'awesome movie really moving and gives a diffrent perspektiv :)'
p29
aS"Just watched The Book Thief with my daughter and allowed her to stay up for \nthis one. Brilliant movie and I'm also guessing that the book is just as \nbrilliant with 400 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list. #bookthief \n  #familytime   #drama  #MarkusZusak "
p30
aS'the movie was amazing! oh my gosh, i cried so much.'
p31
aS"Zusak's writing was meh. He tried too hard. But the story was really good. "
p32
aS'Jewish propaganda shit to divert and focus away the Palestinian Genocide \nfrom the Jews!'
p33
aS"Just finished reading the book and I've never cried so much over a book \nbefore so if the movie is half as good as the book I'll love it "
p34
aS'what a shitty movie '
p35
aS'One thing I hated was how Americanised it was.\n\nShe says "soccer ball", yet the German word Fussball directly translates to \nFootball.\nAlso the film says near the end "1945 - US troops occupy Germany". Oh, the \nAmericans did it themselves did they? No Russian, French or British troops \ninvolved?\nThen they fill an entire shot with an Apple logo right at the end. They \ndidn\'t even try to make it subtle.'
p36
aS'Firstly I read the book and then saw the movie. So..... the movie\'s start \nwas promising and the end was magnificent but the KEY scenes were TOTALLY \nCHANGED!! It was unacceptable. This movie was supposed to be very great \nafter the book...I know it could be more better than it was... ..I think \nthere are important details like who which book gave to whom, why someone \nwent into the war, did someone tell the secret to anybody or not? ..and it \nwas totally changed...those "details" can\'t  be changed......really..music \nwas great by the way (John Williams)'

p44

p45
aS'<3'
p46
aS"I was going to watch this movie in theater with a friend of mine, but the \nonly date we could go was the day before book thief was played so we had to \nchoose another movie. Now I still haven't seen this movie and I can't seem \nto find time to watch it anymore. I really want to see this movie, I think \nit has a very stong subject and it's about a tragic time we shouldn't \nforget."

aS'She had dark brown eyes in the book....'
p53
aS'The movie is good but the book actually captivates you into a world of \nwords and made me cry so much at the end.'
p54
aS"Soul Touching! \n\nThis is my movie review to share with you guys:\n       This movie slapped my drunken soul, an ugly aftermath, a product \ncreated by the modern world, and energized it with humanity. It made me \nappreciate what I have around me,things that I've taken for granted. The \nworld sure have changed from head to toe since then. computerized brains \ndragging our half-asleep bodies in the morning, purposely looking for more \nmoney because it seemed like the good stuff, the stuff that everybody is \nlooking for. It must be good, I thought. It is the power of greed that is \novershadowing our soul, eventually darkness. Like gas chambers that killed \nmany, a creation of the devil. except it isn't physical, something like \ncancer cells, that could grow, spread, and weakens us.\n       I'm really thankful to original author who have wrote this novel and \nthe whole film team who've believed in this soul awakening story, and \npassed on to many. The impact to me personally is overwhelming to say the \nleast. I'm been looking for a film like this desperately for very long as \nmost movies nowadays carries no meanings spiritually. Tonight I'm \nsatisfied! Thank you!\n\nJames"

p63
aS'The Book Thief - Trailer'
p64
aS"this film is terrible. Its boring, badly cast, and the set design is \nlimited. It manages to miss out many vital parts of the book, and leave in \njust simple padding. Their accents spoil the film, especially liesels'. \n\nI wish that after reading the book i had never attempted to watch the film! \nvery disappointing. "
p65
aS"Alright I have to say that I thought this movie was a fantasy flick about \nsomething completely different when I decided to watch it.  I find it so \nhard to cry anymore that it's many years in between when I shed a tear.  I \nwatched this today and I can actually say that I cried.  This was so \nbeautifully written and performed that if you do not feel sorrow for this \nthan you are simply an imbecile who knows absolutely nothing about life and \ndeath.  I am no religious man nor am I a man of government.  But luckily I \nam a man born with a brain and many would argue but a heart as well."
p66
aS'Will anyone finally say what a lousy movie this is!'

(Especially the little \ngirl who played Liesel) not gonna lie, there are certain scenes where my \neyes were proper teary :'( I just don't get why some people always have \nnegative things to say. When I first watched the trailer I found the story \ninteresting so I watched it and i ended up being drawn to it :) <3"
