S"*GOD HELP THE GIRL*, Trailer!\n\nIf I had to choose one single band to listen on my whole life, that would \nbe *Belle & Sebastien/God Help The Girl*\n\nI know, totally unrelated here..\n..but I had to share it; it's an old emotional unexplained thing!"
p1
aS'OHMYGOD! SKINS PURE!'
p2
aS''
p3
aS"God, they couldn't find another name for Hannah Murray that isn't Cassie"
p4
aS'i can only think 1 think is FAPPPPPPPPPPPPPENINGGGGGGGG oi oi oi oiiiiiiiii'
p5
aS'what is the song that is playing during 2:00'

p7
aS'Skins uk?'
p8
aS'what song is this?'
p9
aS'i thought she was jennifer lawrance.....heheh'
p10
aS'02:00 hipster slap?'
p11
aS'Well. That was a sucker punch!'
p12
aS'The actress of Cassie is Cassie in skins mind = blown '
p13
aS'hipsters, hipsters everywhere'
p14
aS"Well here's my review: It meanders around unsure where it wants to go and \nthen ends. The movie is an excuse to put as much quirky hipsterness \ncondensed into a movie, which I like but a lot of you won't. Nothing really \nhappens, I mean lots happens but it doesn't go anywhere and as soon as it \ndoes go somewhere the movie ends. So yeah it's a good time if you want to \njust soak up hipster Glasgow but otherwise it's alright.\n "
p15
aS'Cassie from skins :)'
p16
aS'Cassie from skins and the creepy guy!!!! :D'
p17
aS'That girl from skins '
p18
aS'Years and years and skins uk '

p22
aS"Ok people are whining that I always am negative in my comments this to me \nis the best film of 2014 now I don't think many of you would've seen it but \ni am willing to read both positive AND negative comments "
p23
aS'Belle and Sebastian '
p24
aS'i have a feeling this will end in a hipster orgy'
p25
aS'Emily Browning is wearing way to much clothing to make this worth watching.'
p26
aS'...'
p27

p29
aS'Exceedingly middle-class.'

p31
aS'Cassie <3 that junkie bitch'

aS'you were supposed to be taking care of little Sam, Gilly'
p36
aS"What's a hipster?? "
p37
aS'I don\'t see the point in labeling this as a "hipster" film. The only thing \nI feel that matters is if it\'s good. And I thought it was good, nothing \nspecial but a good movie to just throw on and watch.'
p38
aS'I thought this already came out? '
p39
aS'Is this movie supposed to be about Belle and Sebastian?'
p40
aS'Hannah plays Cassie here like Cassie from skins omg'

p48
aS'This whole trailer I kept on thinking "I know this actor..." only to \nrealize that he played Jakob in the Skins Pure episode with Cassie. How \nodd. '
p49
aS'This looks awful....and boring. Im tired of this type of people.'
p50
aS' skins pure was my favourite '

p72
aS'Casey,!'
p73
aS"i hope you people know that there's a great version online already "
p74
aS'i hate how you do not know what era this film is set in? thats always the \nway with indie films. The dress style could be anything, there seems to be \na lack of technology, all tapes and record players but then there is an \nelement of modern times in it.'
