aS"Especially for the AWESOME +Shamby K \nIt just won't load on hangouts \nYou must see it ASAP-YOU'LL LOVE!! \n\n\nThe LEGO Movie - Official Main Trailer [HD]: http://youtu.be/fZ_JOBCLF-I"

p3
aS"**WARNING** *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*\n\nMy review for The LEGO Movie:\nStars: 3/5\nWhy: I liked the animation, and the interesting storyline. It was very \nfunny with Batman and humorous pop culture references. I was enjoying every \nminute- right up until the proximate-end; where Emmet goes into the real \nworld. It ruined the whole story that happened so far, just because of that \none event. It meant that everything that happened with Emmet was a paradox; \na lie. He was just a minifigure after all, a plaything. If it was just a \nlego movie without the real life part, I would've given it a higher rating. \nBut the part in the end ruined the whole thing, like Jenga; take one block \nout, the whole tower falls.\nBut I gave it extra because I did feel that the animation was very \nimpressive. \nThanks for reading this, and if you have criticism, fire away."

aS'Do the trailer for the lego movie 2'
p68
aS"This movie grossed 460 million dollars. I know that's still a lot but \nseriously? That's about a 400 million dollar profit. With a film of such \nunique storytelling and an ending sequence that left me in a pool of tears \nthat pretty much left me, well, drowning the whole theater in a tidal wave \nof sorrow, I think this film should have made a LOT more money. And I know \nthere are other quality films out there that didn't make enough money as \nexpected to do so, such as Star Trek from 2009, which had a budget of 150 \nmil and made a profit of only 235 mil, considering all the former glory the \nfranchise had in the early days, and that life is unfair blah blah, but, \nall though I'm expecting a lot of hate to be received from this comment, I \nam still expressing my opinion on the internet for everyone to see, and \nthis movie definitely could have made more money. So let the hate comments \nflow, like a river over stone."

You simple minded droolers seeing it two, \nmaybe three times, where do you think this movie is in 20 years? In a 5 \ndollar bin, because it's not worth much else, do you really think this is a \nmovie classic? The Godfather have not grossed as much as Lego Movie!!! \nTHINK ABOUT THAT!!!!!! YOU INCOMPETENT, STUPID, EASILY ENTERTAINED FUCKING \nMORONS!!! but the corporation throws sounds and bright colours at you, so \nyou're blinded, and throw away your money on shit!    \n\nTHINK ABOUT IT, IS THIS AS GOOD AND MEMORABLE AS THE GODFATHER?!?!? IF YOU \nSAY YES, GET A LOBOTOMY!!!!!!!!!!"
