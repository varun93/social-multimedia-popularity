S'Its funny that if this movie was filled with porn scenes and drink/ drugs \n this trailer would have millions of viewers, but because it is a movie \nthat goes against what people are doing in their every day life now a days, \nno one wants to watch it.'

aS"These people don't look at all like kids in the 1950s. Still less like \nkings and queens."

aS"Faithfulness to the book: 6 out of 10: Although the movie is far less of a \nliteral translation than LLLW the basic plot structure is intact. This \nmovie is often criticized for not being true to the book but in reality the \nmain difference is that the islands and events occur in a different order \nthan in the book but most of them in fact are there. However 1 problem is \nthe addition of the things not in the book,most notably,that retarded green \nmist subplot.  That I could have done without.\n\nCasting acting: 8 out of 10: Will Poulter gives a fantastic portrayal of \nEustace and Georgie has always been splendid in her role as Lucy. Liam \nNeeson is fantastic as the voice of Aslan and Ben Barnes is a decent \nCaspian. However I don't go into 9-10 range because I've never been sold on \nSkandar as Edmund.\n\nMusic: 7 out of 10: The score itself is pretty good but I don't care for \nthe song at the end.\n\nSpecial effects/visuals: 10 out of 10: This is an absolutely beautifully \nshot film. I was blown away by how great this movie looked.\n\nPacing: 10 out of 10: This movie never drags at all. Totally engaging start \nto finish.\n\nIs this movie okay for kids?: Yes.\n\nDoes this movie improve on anything from the book?: Yes not because any \nwriting but because this story has many elements that are just so much \nbetter to see than to be told about and as such it's better to watch TVOTDT \nthan to read it. .\n\nIs this a once or twice,a several times,or a many times movie?: A several \ntimes movie. Not a movie I'd watch repeatedly like Harry Potter or Star \nWars but definitely good enough to watch more than just once or twice and a \nMUCH better movie than Prince Caspian.\n\nBook VS Movie: Movie. I usually say movie in this category because of my \npreference for actually seeing things over just being told about them.  But \nthat's even more true here. This is a story that works best visually. \nThings like Eustace's dragon form,the Dufflepuds and how they move,and even \nthe Dawn Treader itself are so much better when you can actually see them \nrather than just be told about them."

aS"The Silver Chair's next! When's that coming out? "
p4
aS'I wish they would make the first book in the Narnia series into a film.'

aS'Does anyone know what is the name of the song that is in the end? Please I \nneed to know!'
p10
aS"The books are very good amazing or epic, even. Very original. Yet, I kinda \nlike the movies more because they are slightly more realistic in some ways. \nIn the books I believe that all of them are a whole lot younger. I love \nthee idea of a little kid kicking butt & that really helps a little kid \nfeel like they can be strong but seeing a 14-year-old Susan shoot a bow & \narrow is more badass. Also Susan's hair isn't ridiculously long in the \nmovies. Also the girls do more fighting so hooray for girl power. I have 2 \nthings about the books and movies that get me so peeved though. Of course, \none is that movies tend to leave out important material from the books. Now \nthe other I have an extremely strong opinion about:Suspian. I love it, it's \nmy OTP. They make a good couple, they got that power couple thing going on \nand they show minor signs of flirting. In the books, they didn't have a \nrelationship though so....GAH that's why we all of a sudden see him \ngoogling over some glowing star chick that I can't spell the name of. I \nmean it's great that he's moving on but 1:he seemed heart broken at the end \nof the last movie when Susan left, as if there'd be no girl for him besides \nher and 2:the star chick is too perfect even though Caspian himself is very \nperfect"

p24
aS'When I read the books, I always pictured the Terlmarines as Italians, I saw \nthem as an allegory for Fascist Italy. So I always assumed Caspian would \nhave an Italian accent.'
p25
aS"It's possible he changed his accent to make his subjects more comfortable \nwith him, seeing him as a Narnian monarch and not a Telmarine one. "
p26
aS'Yeah, wasnt the whole "suspense" factor in the books about Aslan being \nmissing or something? I read these a long time ago, but thats what I \nremember.'

Gresham stated \nthat he plans for The Silver Chair to be the next film to be made, hinting \nthat future films might be made independently. Source - WikiPedia (dot) org'

p90
aS"I'm thinking Caspian's loss of the Spanish accent is supposed to show his \nbeing older and more mature now, as well as having absorbed some of the \nNarnian accent (which is more British) and lost some of the Telmarine \naccent (the Spanish)."

aS'just realized the voice for Aslan is Liam Neson- I think. Badass enough, \nrite?'

aS"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader movie reminds me of the Harry Potter and the \nOrder of the Phoenix movie in that both movies have great personalities of \ntheir own separate from the books but both are true to the spirit and basic \nplot of each book. I actually prefer this over the more literal adaptions \nof The Sorcerer's Stone and the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe."
