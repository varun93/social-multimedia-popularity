p1
aS'Oh.. I didn\'t know "Hannibal Lecter" it\'s a viking ! :|'
p2
aS"Some movies aren't meant to be obvious or full of dialogue or constant \nsituations, or made for mass appeal. This movie is all about imagery, and \nthe way the world looks to a warrior who's been in captivity for god knows \nhow long. He's mute, so it makes sense for the movie to have less dialogue. \nIt also shows the rawness and brutality of a time so long ago and doesn't \nhold back. Not for those with a weak stomach but if you really want to feel \nlike you're in a totally barbaric and archaic part of the past, here you \ngo. This film is more of an experience than a Hollywood blockbuster."
p3
aS'good but ending sucked'
p4
aS'is this very violent movie?and even with one eye mads is very hot...:-)'
p5
aS'Vikings were not christians. They were Pagan and worshiped the Norse Gods. \nWhy is the movie called Valhalla if its not even about true Vikings. '
p6
aS"you need a name _ and you've only got one eye >_<"
p7
aS'Warning this movie is shit'
p8
aS'Great movie and epic ending.. Not a single person who i told to watch this \ngave a positive response so i guess its not a movie for everyone, but still \ni was surprised no one enjoyed it because i was completely blown away.'
p9
aS'i know 1 thing they had   brutal tortures for unfotunate captives like the \nthe eagle.\nwhere as they would slit your sides open and pull lungs through.\nevil bastards'
p10
aS'Ive just seen that movie it was the worst movie ive ever seen, and ive seen \na lot ! It had no plot, things just hapend out of the blue... they did not \ntalk much and u could see that a lot were animated -_-'
p11
aS'horible trailer but exelent movie, pure art..its not for Hollywood lovers'
p12
aS'Worst fucking movie ever!!!!!!!'
p13
aS'this movie reminds me of apocalypse now for some reason'
p14
aS'i think i found the anti... or the false ...  never mind'
p15
aS"A misunderstood film that I really enjoyed, certainly not for everybody, \nbut as metaphorical head trips go, this explains one theory surrounding \nViking Runes found in North America. Not a mainstream/pedestrian movie \ngoing experience but something broader. \n\nIf you're interested in a film that is all obvious surface material then \nlook elsewhere. "
p16
aS'ULTRA PAGAN POWER'
p17
aS'Watch Fuck All Ysll Rising its a Mockbuster'
p18
aS'agree w/wolverine movie suckD balls'
p19
aS'Stubble-y...That count? o.O'
p20
aS'i doubt it if they Disarm most of their Nuclear Bombs which they have \nagreed to do.(Japan and Vietnam is probably the most un-pussy Countries) \ndropping nuclear bombs and Napalm are very cowardly acts,'
p21
aS'BeeJaiDamnation, will you marry me?'
p22
aS'All Im sayin is dont accuse an entire country for being cowardly. Bravery \nand courage are personal traits held (or not) by individuals, not flags. \nIts the soldier that counts, not the whole military. I wouldnt say I have a \nfavorite, I defintaley love my ruger 10/22 for the fun, and any solid bolt \naction rifle that shoots straight. the 1897 is a great gun, been tryin to \nfind one made by winchester but its tough. How are the gun laws in norway, \nheard there very restrictive.'
p23
aS"i like lots of different films but this just bored me. I don't need to see \nshot after shot of Scotland when I was there last week. The trailer is \nselling a completely different film. "
p24
aS"No offense* but I would love to know where your country stands now as far \nas being ''PUSSY''. America itself could probably wipe Europe off the map. \nNorway, you're just a pimple on some fat kids ass. Everybody had their \ntime, even Canada at one point was feared by all."
p25
aS"your right:/ gun laws here are kinda like the north American gun Ban just \nwith no Assault rifles except semi auto AR 15's with 10 rounds only unless \nyou have been in the army where you may have a HK416 or a AG3 which we used \nbefore, after your service in the army, we only really got Sporting & \nHunting guns over here which are on sale..ooh and we do have some WW2 guns \nto"
p26
aS'must be why you are so beautiful;)'
p27
aS'no offence but our Prison system have proven to work better then what they \nhave in the U.S, search it up.. it have been on the news btw;) your one of \nthe 40% fat & stupid Americans and thats what your most known for here in \nEurope lately, you should be ashamed to of yourself to call yourself a \nAmerican if you still have that function in your brain after all those \nhamburgers.. it would not surprise if you went to Mcdonalds 6 hours a day \ninstead of school..'
p28
aS'This movie is shit, and all they do is stare. Enjoy the soundtrack, lel'
p29
aS"hehe yes amazing story. i have abit of highland blood in me but im mainly \nwelsh. we're all barbarians... romans are the only ones i dont take too \nkindly too haha ;p fuckin sandal wearers"
p30
aS'Excellent movie'
p31
aS'nahhh it was great man ^^'
p32
aS'mmmmmm Mads Mikkelson '
p33
aS'all nords can suck a dick and die like faggots that they are! and you too'
p34
aS'"and are still considered to be the most brutal of all races throughout the \nages." citation needed'
p35
aS'haahaha whats the matter? did I get you mad lil bitch? did your pussy get \nwet? fucking cocksucker you have lost you lil bitch just stop talking'
p36
aS'LMAO. What do u like?'
p37
aS'Calling someone a "stupid cunt" makes you even more mature. \nCongratulations. '
p38
aS'I dont get the point of this movie'
p39
aS'Funny, because it seems like a 12 year old wrote this comment.'
p40
aS"Are you kidding me? Have you even seen the pictures and scientific \nANALYSIS?! You know he wasn't asian right?"
p41
aS"yea because thats all USA does these days they spend all their money on the \nMilitary and gets mixed up in any war they can to get more money i miss the \nOld NASA Space Days, ..oooh and you don't have a bomb with the size to even \nbomb little Denmark, not even the Tsar Bomb could do that-.- and by the way \nso are all Scandinavian countries NATO and you would have no reason to bomb \nus randomly with A bombs... "
p42
aS'agreed with this 100% apart from feard all over europe trust me when i say \nthe majority never even knew/heard of Nords'
p43
aS"Oh I forgot! Suicide = Bravery Just because stupid fucks decided they \nwanted to kill themselves doesn't mean shit all. Any mother fucker can get \nin a plain and crash it. I am pretty sure it's easier to crash a plain then \nto actually fly one."
p44
aS'Smells like NEONAZI SHIT'
p45
aS"I'm a descendant of Nords and I also took an interest in their history. It \nmight interest you to know that Nords were possibly the most brutal race \nthere ever ws and are still considered to be the most brutal of all races \nthroughout the ages. So good sir, I'd like to invite you to shut the fuck \nup and stop insulting Nords especially as I and many others have Nordic \nancestors."
p46
aS'what do you mean? what is it that is so threating about Norway or any other \nEuropean country? '
p47
aS'yes, good'
p48
aS"I'm a descendant of Nords and I also took an interest in their history. It \nmight interest you to know that Nords were possibly the most brutal race \nthere ever ws and are still considered to be the most brutal of all races \nthroughout the ages.

p49
aS'what do you mean? what is it that is so threating about Norway or any other \nEuropean country? '
p50
aS'yes, good'
p51
aS'Thats a good question. I suppose it could refer to One Eye having been a \nnorsemen and being partial to Valhalla and other norse mythology during the \ntime of the Christian crusades where they went around slaughtering anyone \nwho wasn\'t or wouldn\'t become christian. And, (spoiler alert), we see all \nof these men killed by non-christians like One Eye and the Native \nAmericans. Hence, norse mythology (Valhalla) is "rising." At least that\'s \nmy rational. Cheers. Love this movie to death.'
p52
aS"I think this movie is that kind of movie who is a master piece, that kind \nwho makes you think, the one who is very good without special effects. It's \na hard one to understand, I didn't understand it myself for the first time, \nbut I think it's one of the best movies I've seen lately. People who think \nTwilight it's a good movie, they'll never find this one enjoyable, that's \nwhat is about the dislikes, but people who really know what a good movie is \nabout, they will give to this one 5 stars! "
p53
aS"ooh did i hurt your feelings? and if if all this happened in the ''1800's \n'' Columbus would not have gone to ''America'' before 2300. and time travel \nis not possible unless you go far into space which i doubt either you or i \nwill, but if i could i actually would;)"
p54
aS"You made yourself one of the fags when you used a hashtag. This isn't \nfucking twitter now is it?"
p55
aS"Why is it called Valhalla rising? it has nothing to do with Valhalla. \nValhalla is a different place to heaven so don't go off and call me stupid \nfor saying this! Valhalla is were the vikings believed only the true \nhonorable warriors would go once they are killed in battle."
p56
aS'norsemen, not saying they arent but i dont think theres a 100%, no doubt \nconclusion that EVERYONE who knows about all ancient peoples would agree \nwith. its a matter of opinion really'
p57
aS'Answer the quastion instead mature women.'
p58
aS'really you are proud for this? when ur great fathers travelled here they \nhad only one aim.kill the natives get their gold and etc. they were just \nsavages.if u dont believe go and search or ask to someone good at \nhistory.btw yeah u feared europe and u like this.what a humanity. i know it \nhappened in the past and conditions of this time were like this.they killed \neveryone without any mercy,stole everything.ur just murderers nothing more'
p59
aS'epic movie'
p60
aS'yes, the best way to defeat a viking is with a even longer Axe which they \nhad and mastered;) Long Live Britain '
p61
aS'amazeballs, truely amazeballs'
p62
aS'A disappointing movie. Looked awesome but the trailer it turned into some \nkind of artsy movie.'
p63
aS' Refn directs like a poet would write, essentialy stripping the whole film \ndown to a very intimate level where we can explore the human condition and \nnot have this experience diluted by random, idle dialogue. As an audience \nwe often expect more of a novel where everything is explained in full \nsentences and it can be hard to grasp a film like this if we are expecting \nsomething less distilled. '
p64
aS'That guy in the movie os thors dad'
p65
aS'Watch it high on marijuana!'
p66
aS"The film is metaphoric, it hasn't got a real scenario, that is hmmm very \nrealistic?... Except from artistic soul you need a lot of knowledge about \npast to understand it..I don't want to quote one wise man, that helped me \nto understand that movie, so i'll leave you with what i wrote."
p67
aS'wait... who is still considered brutal?!'
p68
aS'lskar att se vilka patrioter vi e ^^ '
p69
aS"and i know that ''NATO'' is ''fucking'' American controlled! are you really \nthat stupid?! i'm saying that Scandinavia is your ally and we have never \nbeen having a cold relationship and hopefully never will, and i also hope \nthat you do not even speak for 0.00001% of America.. and i can understand \nthat your country is going under some hard times and so will might we \nNorwegians do as well with our current shitty ''Prime minister Jens \nstoltenberg'' of ours that thinks we can live on sea oil forever,"
p70
aS"If they won they would've been brave, they lost so it was stupid, not brave."
p71

p79
aS"One of the weirdest and trippiest films I've ever seen. I recommend you \nwatch this film high. It's so worth it"
p80
aS'Must be the Nordic awesome-ness in me ;)'
p81
aS'This movie made no sense at all...the fighting scenes were pretty good, but \nother than that it was a shitty movie...sorry to say :/ just my opinion'
p82
aS'how else do you think we got Red heads in Scandinavia? ;)'
p83
aS'Yes, I have come to understand this as well.'

p92
aS'everyone who thinks this movie is amazing and has opened their eyes to new \nand wonderful things, you are all fuckin sheltered individuals.'
p93
aS'im one of those artsy fartsy people who doesnt need a action scene every 10 \nminutes too.but I can tell you this.........this movie sucks'
p94
aS'I expected a detailed account of a Viking warrior, but this movie was a \nhuge trippy let down.'
p95
aS"Clearly he knows nothing of the true Nordic culture because he wouldn't \nhave the balls to call them pussies, they were far too brutal to be \nconsidered something as vulgar as 'pussies'. As a proud Nordic descendant, \nI must say his label for them is revolting and if only I had a time \nmachine, I would send him back to face the savagery that was the Nords."
