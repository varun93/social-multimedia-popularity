S'just watched this movie, all the characters were wonderfully intriguing... \nbut as soon as the "graceful and beautiful" princess aurora (the one \nnearing 16) and Prince Philip showed up on screen, i wanted to take of my \nshoes and throw them at the screen, the amount of cheese those characters \nradiated was amazing, they broke me out of the sort of enchanted world i \nfelt the movie was bringing into. the princess was prancing around and \ncalling things beautiful and i could only see the actress not the \ncharacter, whilst the prince was unimportant and i wonder why he showed up \nat all.'

aS'Maleficent (2014)       May 30th, 2014 '
p2
aS'this shit look stupid.'
p3
aS'Oh come on! Stop taking good old german tales and mutate them into an \naction movie. Get your own cultural assets.'
p4
aS'shouldn\'t Maleficent say "she will fall into a death-like sleep", not a \n"sleep-like death" as she says here, it implies something quite different.'
p5
aS'All things considered, It is true that Hollywood is probably running out of \nideas, and part of that is because creativity is underrated nowadays. \nHowever, whatever original story this "bastardized" from, that is \nirrelevant. Even if this in your mind, a rip-off of your favorite fairy \ntale, as long as the movie is of quality and has good actors what does it \nmatter? I may be in the minority on this, but personally, I really liked \nit.'
p6
aS"Angie is the only person that's hot in this movie... rest of them are ugly"
p7
aS'Like if you came from TORRENT site :)'
p8
aS'Poor brothers grimm though, Hollywood totally disregards literature \nnowadays...'
p9
aS"A shameless politically correct manifesto in the form of a fairy tale.\nWhat really bothers me though is that americans became so out of touch with \nthe intelectual world of their country that they can't see the influences \non their art and entertainment. Look at the joke that is this coment \nsection."
p10
aS'Hate theis types of movies where they take a famous fariytale and change it'
p11
aS'Maleficent is a bit like sleeping buety'
p12
aS"Honestly... I didn't care much about this movie when it was first \nannounced. But after watching this trailer. I can honestly say that i am \n... Intrigued.\n\nOne of the things i dislike about disney is the lack of grey areas when it \ncomes to define good and evil. A pure innocent heroine against a vilain \nthat is pure evil only or the sake of being... pure evil.\n\nIt's interesting that they choose to make a sleeping beauty movie which \nthis time focuses it's attention on the vilain. It seems obvious that \nMaleficent is still an evil being, but one that this time seems to have an \nactual background and motivation for her actions.\n\nI hope that Maleficent doesn't end being a misundertood hero, but rather a \ncomplexe vilain that will make us question if her actions are justified or \nno.\n\nWe'll see. But so far this movie seems really interesting."
p13
aS"I was hoping they'd keep her evil and spiteful"
p14
aS"The actress who plays Aurora doesn't look like a sixteen year old. She \nlooks like she's thirteen."
p15
aS'1:19 activate agent Kruger!!!! :D:D:D:D:D:D'
p16
aS'love this so much'
p17
aS'Next movie they do is humpty dumpty, but that sounds stupid so they will \ncall it the wall, and he will be a great knight that defends the city from \nhordes of demons and kills them when they try to climb the wall but then he \nfalls in a battle against the pan lord and he falls off the wall and dies \nbecause every fantasy story needs a big stupid action scene in it'
p18
aS'Hopefully this one won\'t be another case of "the trailer was better than \nthe actual film itself." '
p19
aS"I am just thankful that this isn't another sequel to a non-existent movie \n(like 2013's Alice in Wonderland was) This way I might actually be able to \nconnect with the characters."
p20
aS'From what I see in this trailer, Maleficent is not the villan... the father \nis?'
p21
aS'damn i cant remember the name of this but i recognize it from somewhere.. \nbut it wasnt the witch that was the star it was some girl who slept in a \ncastle'
p22
aS"This is a great film, can't wait for its release on blu-ray."
p23
aS'Considering we got close to nothing about Maleficent on the Sleeping Beauty \nmovie, this trailer got me thinking about those wings. How cool would it be \nif she was the likes of a fallen angel?'
p24
aS'when I read all these comments, where people all over the world is fighting \neach other, and this, because of things, the top legion did to us, I could \ncol ! What it has to take, to make every single of us understand, that we \nare all just the assets of a pervert game? You wanna do yourself a favor? \nThan stop doing, what they want u to do! Its up to u, what u think! I`m not \nsaying more!'
p25
aS'<3'
p26
aS'lmao now find out the truth DISNEY !!!'

p30
aS"One of the most beautiful women of all time is playing the sexiest \nfairytale villain and it's releases on my birthday. Thank you Disney"
p31
aS"I'm not very fond of Angelina Jolie, I'd watch it otherwise."
p32
aS"Looks pretty good, I just don't like that the fairies are small..."
p33
aS'Disney is very violent nowadays =/ '
p34
aS'Toller Film. Ich war gestern mit meinem Mann und den Kindern im Kino. Wobei \nich finde, fr eine 6Jhrige ist die Handlung an manchen Stellen doch schon \nsehr gruselig.'
p35
aS'Didn\'t Maleficent bestow the gift of pricking her finger and dying?... then \nMaryweather gave her the gift of just falling asleep until "True love\'s \nfirst kiss" wakes her???? How come the trailers for the movie tryna make it \nlook like Maleficent was misunderstood? Is evil good now? O.o'
p36
aS"A million dollars says the movie ends with some such bullshit like \nMaelificent lifted the curse instead of the Prince and everything is \nSharlto's fault. "
p37
aS'My only complaint is that.... how can Maleficent be so weak in the final \nfight....COME ON... MORE POWERFUL MAGICS! YOU ARE MALEFICENT THE MOST \nPOWERFUL FAERIE!'
p38
aS'Anything Angelina Jolie plays........ so FUCKING good!'
p39
aS'i tend to find unique things to analogies with.....typically you can find \nthe uniqueness in the score.........then there are other things \nOBVIOUSLY....but the stories are often old  as all NEW things are.'
p40
aS"You got to work out more you guys have to show a little bit more work \nbecause you guys don't really show any work show the whole movie on \nmalificent"

p66
aS'Is she a Green Planeswalker?'
p67
aS"Seems to be a growing trend of taking all of these old tales, these Disney \nanimated films and spinning them into Hollywood blockbusters.  I must \nsay.....I'm quite bored of it :/ But they make money and appease to enough \npeople, just not remotely my cup of tea."

aS'awesome :D'
p77
aS"1:55 What a big bird.. Oh wait, that's a dragon"
p78
aS'Why did Disney choose Elle Fanning to portray Aurora? Personally, I believe \nthat it was not so much because of her age or beauty(although they do \nfigure in), but more so because she is possessed with an uncanny ability to \nact.'
