aS'well, in this situation he isn\'t the "bad guy". it\'s just as they said "he \ngot tired of the bullshit." I personally love this concept. the "good" \nturning around and becoming the reason why others will lose their lives. I, \nmyself, am agnostic, but I can understand why you feel this way, but \nremember: it\'s just a movie.'
p48
aS'Awesome movie, really well done. A million times better than Book of Eli!'

aS'if you wanna watch a good movie with this theme rather watch the 1995 movie \ncalled The Prophecy '
p60
aS"Seen this movie. Thumbs down. Rented it from the redbox from $1 plus tax \nand I still feel like I got ripped off. To anyone who hasn't seen this \nfilm, don't waste your time or your money. It sucked!!!!"
p61
aS"This movie sucked. Unanswered questions, bad script, poorly directed. O ya \nand if god loses faith in mankind then wouldn't he just do like a supernova \nand not send badass angels down to kill people. Only good part is wen tht \nkickass angel came into the diner and sliced people up with his wings. Only \ngood part in the movie. Rest sucked. Remember this people. Good ideas don't \nalways make good movies"

p75
aS'This seemed to be a love or hat movie. I enjoyed it'
p76
aS'lol grandma.'
p77
aS'"I don\'t even believe in God." Funny. In his next role after this, he plays \nan insane religiously corrupt God-fearing priest blaming our Lord for all \nthe \'evil\' in the world.'
p78
aS'how the hell! man this crap is reversed arent the demons suppose to let the \nanti christ baby come to life.. and that baby is not the only hope for \nsurvival on earth damn the media is some crap and the shit that it does to \npplz minds is so fuked up '

p80
aS'this isnt hd'
p81
aS"Man....I thought this movie was going to be so good....but as already \nstated, it was awful. It had potential, but the piss poor directing, \nediting and mediocre acting took the wind right out of it's sails. Too bad \ntoo, because I really like both Paul Bettany and Kevin Durand."
p82
aS"Terrible God is a loving god I don't understand why people would make him \nthe bad guy"
p83
aS"This movie looked like darker version of Feast (2005) but with \nangels/demons. Anyway, it was decent I think, Legion is one of the most \nunderrated horror films of the 2000's (next to Reeker, Wrong Turn, Cabin \nFever, Kill Theory, High Tension, Wilderness, Burning Bright, Sleepless, \nThe Fourth Kind, Triangle, Venom, Tamara, Ghost Ship, Final Destination 2, \nCreep, House of Wax, House of 9, Exam, Black Christmas, Cold Prey, Shrooms, \nThe Ruins, The Collector, Quarantine and 100 Feet)"
