S"One of the best movie I've ever seen..but hate the ending :("
p1
aS'I love the Camera work on that movie. Story was good, but I did not like \nthe end :/'
p2
aS"Love long thriller's especially ones that are good throughout, 418 people \ndon't like that mark Wahlberg directed this...but yea make sure u got  \n2hr30min for this movie!"
p3
aS"I hated it! then ending wasn't right! very horrible movie the ending \nspoiled it all "
p4
aS'If there was a Last of Us movie, Hugh Jackman would have been a great Joel'
p5
aS'Spoiler Alert: This is one of the best movies ive seen in a while. I kinda \nforgot Hugh Jackman can really act when he isn\'t barring claws. But since \nthe movie had alot of religious undertone. I feel like the reason Hugh\'s \ncharacter is locked away is for his inability to "forgive those who \ntrespass ".  Him being tucked away is like poetic justice for his torture \nof an innocent man. And dont be so upset with the ending. Its safe to \nassume Loki found him'
p6
aS"Am I the only one who wouldn't trust a detective named Loki?"
p7
aS'OVERRATED MOVIE'
p8
aS"This movie was great. The ending was pretty controversial. I would've \nenjoyed the ending more if they had left out the last 7 seconds."
p9
aS'This is what every episode of Law and Order should of been like.'
p10
aS"**Spoiler alert**\n\n\nWe were supposed to feel bad about what happened to Alex but didn't he \nabduct the girls in the first place? He was the one who took them in the \ncamper and the old lady decided to keep them. So in the end, the father was \nright to torture the guy wasn't he? All that time he knew where they were! \nSo why wasn't Alex charged with kidnapping? "
p11
aS"When I saw this movie, I loved it. This is prolly the best crime drama \never. This film was well acted and well scripted. It's rare to see a movie \nthis good now a days. This movie is a classic"
p12
aS'First half is an incredible engaging drama, second half is a muddled, \nserial-killer mess. But the performances are GREAT.'
p13
aS'i smell a torture scene....\navoiddddd watches anyway'
p14
aS"Why did Keller go back to the old lady's house for the last time?"
p15
aS"SPOILER ALERT:\n\nI hated how the movie ended but we can all assume that Detective Loki went \nto investigate the sound of the whistle and he would find Keller Dover in \nthere right? Because that's what I would assume and everyone should also \nplus why would he do nothing about that whistle sound at the end so he \nfound Keller Dover and went to go see his family."
p16
aS'Movie4k.to bitches!!'
p17
aS"Damn, just watched this movie... and it was amazing. Had me on the edge of \nmy seat trying to figure out who was behind it all. Don't get why people \nsay the ending was bad... it's obvious what happens! He heard a whistle and \nis obviously going to check it out and find out what it is. Ending was \nperfect in my opinion."
p18
aS"WOW such a GOOD film, I usually don't write reviews for movies but the \nsuspense had me going through out the whole movie. A little hard to watch \nat some points but AMAZING if you like movies with TWIST and that make you \nTHINK."
p19
aS'FANTASTIC MOVIE WITH INCREDIBLE ACTING, ESPECIALLY FROM Jake Gyllenhaal'
p20
aS'Hey anyone whos watched this movie, is it good? I might watch it'
p21
aS"A very intense and gripping movie, although towards the end I found it lost \nit's realism and began falling into the styles of it's genre. It had me \nguessing the whole time and seemed to be building up to something very \ncool, but I kinda felt a bit let down in the end."
p22
aS'Joel from the last of us is in this movie? ^_^'
p23
aS'apparently liam neeson did a very good job looking for her daughter, \nwolverine sucks'
p24
aS'Terrific film but awful trailer--way too long and reveals way too much.'
p25
aS"Honestly the trailer doesn't do this movie justice. I am so surprised that \nthis didnt get nominated everyone did an amazing job. IT was so raw and \nrealistic. "
p26
aS"Anyone else think that the most disturbing scene in this movie was when \nAlex was strangling the little dog...? And I don't like how Keller \ninadvertently let that little dog get hit by a car and die."
p27
aS'That was one fucked up movie'
p28
aS"Amazing amazing amazing movie, great story line and amazing acting!\nIf you haven't watched this you're missing out"

p33
aS"One of the best movies i've ever watched but the ending will make you \nmad.(Easily a 10/10)"
p34
aS"i didn't like the ending! : /"
p35
aS"I don't understand why the little girl Joy said that she saw Keller in the \nhouse where they were kidnapped, this made me feel confuses... Can someone \nexplain this to me? because in that moment Keller ran and escaped from the \nHospital  :S "

p37
aS'great movie. teaches you a real lesson'
p38
aS"This movie was amazing, great acting & performances. Engaging, makes you \nthink & there's so many angles at play. I see a lot of people didn't like \nthe ending, I didn't either because it doesn't give you much closure but it \nwas still fuckin' great."
p39
aS"This trailer sucked... big time... 'cause this movie is one of the best \nmovies i've ever seen... great great acting from Hugh jackman (!), Paul \nDano and Jake Gyllenhaal, perfect soundtrack... the ending is not so good, \nbut still... its a must see"
p40
aS'loved the movie.\nIdk about yall but I kinda guessed it was the aunt really early on.'

aS'the movie really haunted me not even a horror film can do that to me i \nalways knew abduction is a terrible thing but this movie made me realize \nhow terrifying it is. when i have children i will never let them go play \nnear an RV lol fantastic film'
p49
aS"Whoops, so boring, that even Maria Bello slept through most of it. Watch \nher in The Cooler with William H. Macy instead!!\n\nSeemed like a bunch of disjointed entities at work. No on-screen chemistry. \nSaw that before in a movie with Jackman (even though I think he's a great \nactor): 'Scoop' with cutiepie Johansson.\n\nWill never learn to appreciate the doe eyes of you know who."
p50
aS"i don't know why everyone hates the ending ? it wasn't bad, they didn't \nshow us that they found him but the ending means that the detective hears \nsomeone whistle so he search and search finally found him and he goes to \nthe jail and thats it "
p51
aS"Possible spoiler......... Just saw the movie and it was one of the best on \nthe edge of ur seat I've seen in a long time. But I gotta say the father of \nthe girl named Anna was just as bad as the abductor of the kids. Cruel \nbastard."

aS'Best movie ever, for real'
p54
aS'very good intense trailer loved the movie'
p55

p61
aS'Great movie'
p62
aS"Good movie, with awesome actors, except the fact that they repeatedly bash \nchristians and this movie is very left sided to the point of frustration. \nWell, I guess that's hollywood for you."
p63
aS'(DONT READ IF YOU HAVENT SEEN IT YET)\n\nYes Alex knew where those kids were. His aunt may have been the leader but \nthe dude who was found in the priest basement told them that they have a \nfamily of kidnappers which were them. Never understood the snake thing tho. \nAnd I wish he would have tortured Alex more with that hot water because he \nwith held info. repeatedly. So sad for the dad tho he should have whistled \nharder OR ATLEAST THREW THE WHISTLE UP AT THE WOODEN PLY SO IT WOULD MAKE A \nMORE DISTINCT NOISE THAN THAT LOW ASS WHISTLE '
p64

p91
aS"Amazing movie!\nBefore it even came out in theaters officially, some a$shole ruined it in \nthe comments\n\nI saw it the day it came out (by myself)... I was in awe. \n\nI don't know why I didn't comment after I saw the movie. lol\n"
