p10
aS'this movie made me cry , i loved it.'
p11
aS"I hate this movie. It angers me that they took a book with a serious \nmessageand dded so much silly filler to it. I am not saying that I dont \nthink movies should have fun in them  Dr Seuss stories are full of funbut \nhe would not be happy to know that this movie contains obnoxious kid humor. \nNeither would he be happy about the hypocrisy (if you don't know what I \nmean it is this movie and its marketing betraying the original book's \nmessage). Dr. Seuss books do not translate well into feature films because \nyou have to add so much to fill out the story. I hated the Grinch movie, \nbecause the changes/filler added nothing to the story. The Horton Hears a \nWho movie had too many pop culture references (Like the anime \nreference...what was the point of that?) and the less said about the \nhorrendous and inappropriate Cat in the Hat movie, the betterand now this \none. I understand the allure of creating a Seuss-like world on film.  They \nshould have just made a movie version of the musical Seussical. At least \nit is the right length and they would not have to pad it with filler."
