S'Watched this last night. Captivating.'
p1
aS'People that dont like this film are just ignorant people with no love for \nthe actual ART of film and are just out to watch something that is spoon \nfed to you. Anyone that truly loves film will love this movie so much, by \nfar one of my favourites. '
p2
aS'This will be decent. '
p3
aS'I came for Jake, I thought It would be great movie because he was there but \nI was wrong! He chose bad movie. :O OMG, so waste my time, This is so \nboring movie, Lol especially for soundtracks, that makes this movie duller. \nThis is basically porn, God, I had to forward many times. And you know the \nend is more desperately horrible! Just save your time.'
p4
aS'1:47 What is THAT?'
p5
aS'Right is it shit or is it good ?'
p6
aS"This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. Waste of an 1 \nhour n 30 mins of my life. It's like having a monkey as a director trying \nto be artistic and clever. Do not watch this movie!!"
p7
aS"I swear to God that if this is another double personality movie, I'm gona \nbe pissed! The only double personality movie that's worth a crap is Fight \nClub, all others are terrible."
p8
aS'I cant find this movie anywhere , WTF!? '
p9
aS"I dont know why they're so anal about there being the two of them ,like is \nobvious they're twins split at birth unless it turns into Orphan Black"
p10
aS'Reminds me of "Lost Highway" and "Moon"...'
p11
aS'after watching.. >>> how am i suppose to feel?... but.really this film is \nart..'

p13
aS'Looks good, but let me guess. He has a multiple personality disorder that \nwas created when something traumatic happened to him in the past, and ended \nup living two lives after that. Or bi-polar/schizo, etc. '
p14
aS'I was full of hope ;maybe this time something good will come out of this \ncountry. ..and another unfortunate try . Surrealism from canada ?Please! \n.Leave it to europeans .Pictures /the best thing in this film/realy shown \nhow grey;boring and mediocre we are.'
p15
aS'wow how shit is the trailer cant imagine how shit the movie is'
p16
aS'The Enemy is about a guy\'s nightmare. I dunno if that\'s what the \nwriters/director intended to convey, but after that final scene I thought \n"oh shit this was just a nightmare" and it all made sense and made me enjoy \nthe whole thing.'
p17
aS'Can someone explain this mess to me; I have seen the movie and I understand \nstring theory more than I do this movie. '
p18
aS"I really liked this, Its funny because I had been interpreting the movie \nwrong the whole way, taking it all far too literally (apart from the \nobviously symbolic spider imaginary).\nOnly at the very last abrupt scene did I realize what the film was actually \nabout. I hadn't been watching the fairly predictable story I had assumed I \nhad been, I'd just watched something totally different, a slap in the face, \nand it was awesome."

aS'SPOILER , DONT READ UNLESS U VE WATCHED THE MOVIE                         \n Anthony has affair with Mary. Then, she realizes hes married, they get \ninto the fight (as seen towards the end of the movie) and later they have a \ncar crash. He survives the accident, however gets injured. Thats how he \ngot scars. Helen, of course, finds out that he had been in an accident with \na woman he was having an affair with, however she forgives him. There is a \nclue that Mary survived the accident as well, which will be mentioned later.\n\nAnthony tries to carry on with his life, but its difficult. On one hand, \nhes overwhelmed with guilt, on the other, hes not ready to give up his \nformer lifestyle (which is chasing other women, as his mother mentioned).He \nstarts visiting sex clubs and thats how he tries to conquer his problems, \nbut not permanently. Notice how a spider is stepped on and crushed in a \nclub scene. I believe spider represents his fear of life with Helen and \nbecoming a father.\n\nHowever, the fear (along with possible guilt) reemerges and he needs to \ndeal with it some other way. Thats when he creates an alter ego  Adam, a \ncollege professor. He probably looked up colleges and ran into Adams name \nand unconsciously decided to use that name for his new personality. A \nprofessor named Adam Bell indeed exists, however when both Anthony and \nHelen look him up, they find only the name, no pictures. Therefore, he \ncould be anyone.\n\nNotice how most of Adams life (which takes place only in Anthonys mind) \nis somewhat surreal and empty. He teaches the students same lesson twice \n(at the beginning of the movie) and once he even walks into the empty \nclassroom. Classes shown at the beginning take place in Anthonys mind, \nhowever, walking into empty classroom indeed happens, since later he runs \ninto Helen. I believe empty classroom is meant to show us that he does not \nteach at the university.\n\nThrough Adam, Anthony tries to detach himself from his real life. Notice \ntheres only half of the whole picture, which is later shown in his and \nHelens apartment. As Adam, he symbolically cut off Helen from his life \n(therefore, the torn picture) and has a relationship with Mary. However, \nthe pieces of his real life start popping into his consciousness while hes \nin his dream world as Adam. Thats why Adams friend (who is also figment \nof Anthonys imagination) recommends him to watch the movie. Thats when \nthe imaginary world starts to collapse.\n\nHelen notices theres something wrong with her husband. At first, she \nthinks hes having an affair with Mary, AGAIN. Thats what makes me think \nthat Mary survived the accident, as well. Helen gets suspicious, looks up \nthe alleged professor and decides to pay him a visit to find out whether he \nwas a jealous husband. When she arrives at the university, there is a \nshocking revelation. She runs into Anthony, who was, at the time, \ncompletely overtaken by his alter ego. Shes upset, which is shown in later \nscene where she says something like: I think you know whats going on. \nShe is not sure whether Anthony has a mental illness or hes playing a \ntrick on her.\n\nAnthony is unaware of his condition and meets up with Adam. The meeting, of \ncourse, takes place in his head, therefore the isolated motel. Adam, who is \nabout to get destroyed (since Anthony will possibly find out hes just an \nalter ego) suddenly withdraws from conversation, therefore allowing Anthony \nto carry on with delusion.\n\nAnthony now wants to stay with Helen, but to have an affair Mary as well. \nThats why he insists on taking Mary to a romantic holiday. Instead of it, \nhe returns to his and Helens apartment, but this time as Adam, since his \nalter ego had overtaken him. Helen notices hes being awkward and wants to \nfind out whether hes into Adams character again. Thats why she asks him: \nHow was school?. Now, shes certain of his mental condition. He falls \nasleep and has dreams of his accident with Mary. When he awakes, he \nrealizes that somethings wrong with him, breaks down and cries. Helen \nshows him support and asks him to stay, meaning she liked Adam personality \nbetter than the original.\n\nFor a while, everything seems to be in order. Next morning, he hears about \nsome accident, but turns off the radio, since it reminds him of the one he \nhad. Now he becomes a dictator, who censors the information. When he finds \nthe key for club, he switches into his old self and his fears of fatherhood \n(and perhaps women in general reappear) and thats why he sees Helen as a \ngiant spider. Thats the moment when history repeats itself. His fear of \nthe women may have been caused by his relationship with mother, who seems \nto be somewhat distant and shows little understanding for his problems.'
p26
aS"Really hated the ending in this movie, and why did it get 7/10 ratings on \nimdb? I'm confused..."
p27
aS"Obviously there are people here who don't appreciate the fact that a movie \ncan be made to challenge their lazy intellects. These people should never \nwatch another Villeneuve movie, love it or hate it this director will \nalways challenge your preconceived ideas about life and yourselves. Go \nwatch the ninja turtles instead it's a movie about great classical Italian \npainters :)"
p28
aS'the bad comments on here are why film has become so generic and fucking \nboring. this movie is art and any decently smart person should be excited \nwhen a movie actually keeps you on your toes. '
p29
aS'why is it so dramatic. they can just get a dna test or something and go \nfrom there.'
p30
aS'From the scale of Donnie Darko to S. Darko, how good is this film?'
p31
aS'WHAT TRASH, so sad we have F#$K#D up TRASH movies like this, no wonder WHY \nAMERICA IS NUTS. DO NOT WATCH THIS TRASH MOVIE. I WASTED 2 hours of my \nLIFE, and NOW I CANT GET IT BACK, If you want garbage like this, THEN JUST \ngo take a trip to the mental hospital,and you will see how people need help \nfrom mental illness. THIS IS JUST GARBAGE.'
p32
aS'Am I the only one that dosent understand shit!'
p33
aS'Can anyone briefly explain what just happened at the end? Because Ive been \nsitting like a retard for half an hour trying to figure out what was that.'
p34
aS'Looks like another fight club plot. But I hope not.'
p35
aS"SPOILERS: The movie might be cyclical just like the novel's ending, but in \na more mindfuck way.  Remember, the picture he sees in a Anthony's \napartment is torn up earlier when he's Adam, and the the ending implies \nhe's going to the sex club, because Adam has become Anthony, will continue \nbeing unfaithful, get divorced, tear up the picture, and have the same \nrevelation.  My opinion is that the opening scene actually takes place \nafter the ending, with him having decided to go to the club, thus leading \nto him tearing up the photo and having a mental breakdown while becoming \nAdam.   That, or the movie is an impenetrable web of obtuse nonsense meant \nto make you wonder, and that's the point of the spiders."
p36
aS"who was responsible for the lighting for this movie could it be any more \norange it just looks like one of those movies that doesn't really make \nsense and is going to raise a lot more questions than answers "

aS"Watched this, expected it to be a really fast paced thriller, but no, it's \nnot. Jake's acting is fantastic but the movie is boring.

p95
aS"I haven't watched it yet, but i have a feeling this is just one of those \nartsy fartsy overrated movies. Am I right?"
p96
aS"I just finished watching it. It did seem very confusing at first however \nafter reading several interpretations it made sense. It has a lot of depth \nand symbolism to it and Jake Gyllenhaal's performance was as always \noutstanding. So all in all, go watch it's worth your time, in my opinion.  "
