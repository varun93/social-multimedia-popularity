S'Disappointing. 4/10 stars. \n\nThis film was heavily inspired by other films in the same genre before it. \nThere was not a single unique quality about it.'
p1
aS"It looks good but let's be honest it is very similar to I am robot. But who \nknows maybe it's a prequel"
p2
aS'just use a EMP'
p3
aS"If you didn't know Automata movie is free for Gold members on Xbox one "
p4
aS'*Automata*. Pomalej film, ale podstatu mylenky evoluce zachytil. Roboti \njsou nae dti. Budou lep a doshnou dle. '
p5
aS'so we got all this shit in the future but nobody comes up with an idea to \nEMP the little bastards lel wut, this is one of those movies that can be \nended in one fell swoop but we need plot, dont really like movies like this \nlol'
p6
aS'**tips fedora**'
p7
aS'And yes all of the comments are about i, Robot '
p8
aS'interesting concept... just like The Animatrix "The Second Renaissance"... \nhopefully this will end on a better tone than that, because we all know how \nthe Matrix started. I don\'t think we\'re very far off from creating AI, but \nwe need to make sure we can co-exist with our creations, otherwise it\'ll be \na disaster'
p9
aS'THE DAWN OF ROBOTS HAS RISEN!!!!! WILL THEY BE OUR GREATEST CREATION? OR \nTHE END OF ALL MANKIND?'
p10
aS'Guess the film industry is running out of ideas on movies to make.'
p11
aS'So... I Robot?'
p12
aS"I'm a sucker for AI stuff, so possibly biassed, but this looks like it \nmight be kinda good. Possibly. Maybe."
p13
aS'lol so what a i robot ripoff lmao fucking sad'
p14
aS"How can it be that I didn't know of this movie until today?"
p15
aS"I'm a sucker for AI stuff, so possibly biassed, but this looks like it \nmight be kinda good. Possibly. Maybe."
p16
aS'Automata, film o robotech a zjevn i klasicky vesel budoucnosti lidstva. \nNajdete v nm Antonia Banderase. '
p17
aS'Wow an I Robot remake, so original.'
p18
aS'If they would have called it "I, Robot 2" I would have believed it... I \nmean, it looks like a fun movie and I am not hating it, at least for now, I \nwill judge it when i see it... but the resembles with I, Robot is too \nstrong. \n\nOn a side note: they do actually plan to make a second part for I, Robot..'
p19
aS"Oh look another future morality issue of what we don't understand. I'll \nshelf this right next to bicentennial man, A.I., Irobot, her, and the one \nwith johnny derp. Not an original idea, just another emotional \nrollercoaster."
p20
aS'1:45 what movie was he playing in? '
p21
aS'This is just I am robot'
p22
aS"Im gonna watch this even if the concept is similar to I Robot. That \nshouldn't take away from the entertainment."
p23
aS'Looks a little Blade Runner ish.'
p24
aS"This reminds me of The Animatrix (Matrix prequel). If you haven't seen it, \nyou need to. It's better than the matrix itself."
p25
aS'Can we get a man/machine co-existence movie that doesn\'t rely on the \nawfully outdated "three laws of robotics" for it\'s plot?'
p26
aS'Looking forward to Autmata, to be released Oct 10th. /cc +Rod Furlan'
p27
aS"I can't believe I totally missed this movie did anyone get a chance to see \nAutomata and liked it?"
p28
aS"This kinda reminds me of I Robot... And I'm not trolling either. It really \ndoes reminds me of I Robot. "
p29
aS'This actually looks very interesting. Hopefully turns out good...and \ncontinue to support the theory that Robots will inevitably take over the \nworld.'
p30
aS'shit movie'
p31
aS'I Robot'
p32
aS"I already wached this Movie today, it's really very amazing Movie about \nRobot's it's look like I-Robot Will Smith Movie, but Automata is better as \nI-robot, here Robot's look very realistic and creative and does not have as \nmuch computer specheffect as I-robot , I recommend  everyone  watch the \nmovie is really best Movie."
p33
aS'Why do some comments have no "reply" button? Is this something you can \ncontrol through settings?'
p34
aS'Not bad.'
p35
aS'"Just a violent ape"'
p36
aS'Just saw it... not so similar to i robot as i thought it would be, and yes \ni liked it very much...'
p37
aS"I don't care about bad reviews. Too bad I can't find one damn theater \nshowing this movie. I'd like to see it. "
p38
aS'ITS ZORO BUT WHY IS HE BALD'
p39
aS'We all know how it ends up when  we let machines think for us, cough skynet \ncough'
p40
aS'Is this like "I-robot"?'
p41
aS'Just saw it. Save your money.'
p42
aS"This movie is bad.Not because the usual reasons a movie is bad but because \nit is scares us.It faces us with a plausible version of the future and \nshows how fragile life is  how powerless we can be. For me this movie had a \nperfectly happy ending even if humanity will be destroyed. Robots are the \nhumans legacy. They are the second evolution. In essence we are machines \ntoo,organic machines but machines, It does not matter what are you made of \nas long as you are intelligent self aware and can adapt to it's environment \nand survive,the definition of life somewhat applies. We do not know nowhere \nnear enough about life because we only know one kind and in our universe \npossibilities in theory are infinite. It would be nice to know that even if \nhumanity ultimately fails we will have something to carry on our legacy to \nremember what we war and we have done. But it was still quite a crap movie."

p47
aS"I, Robot \n\nPlease we already have this kind of movie ..... and we're pretty bored with \nit ..... "
p48
aS'So,is this like a good version of I,Robot?'
p49
aS'when I watched I, Robot and said "this would be better with less Will \nSmith", I didn\'t mean "let\'s add to Banderas instead".\n\nWrite something that hasn\'t been done 1000 times before for once, jesus.'
p50
aS'I am very much looking forward to it.'
p51
aS"Why don't they just make an Assassin's Creed movie?"
p52

aS'interesting movie. heavily flawed, but interesting nontheless.'
p61
aS'This movie was interesting. No what I was hoping for, but still good! I was \nhoping the units would rebel more, and by that what I mean is to stand up \nfor themselves, fight back. But it did tugg on the heart strings a bit. I \nwas hoping for a little more action from the units though. I give this \nmovie 5.5/10'
p62
aS'iRobot meets Her meets that movie where assasins go back in time to commit \nsuicide meets John Wicks!!!'
p63
aS'I thought it was ok, could have been more interesting. Transcendence is \nmuch better!'
p64
aS"i think it looks awesome. kinda reminds me of i robot, but i think it will \nbe good. Futuristic, action, with A.I. and robots i'm excited.  "
p65
aS"Don't know about  anyone else but I feel sorry for the bots in this film. \nHumans can be creeps some times."
p66
aS'boooring'
p67
aS'Well it seem to be just like a mixture of I,Robot and Blade Runner in \nmodern style with a spanish touch, but why not, i mean still can be good :)'
p68
aS"Just saw Automata...\nIt's a great movie. It could even be called *Blade Runner Beta*. Highly \nrecommended."
p69
aS'first half of this movie is ok... the rest is too long too boring.'

p78
aS'i was thinking this movie was all about automata theory... :p'
p79
aS'a solid scifi film.'
p80
aS"Melanie Griffith looks a lot better than pictures I've seen in the media \nridiculing her plastic surgery.  I'm glad to see she's doing well and she \nand Tony Banderas are doing a movie together.  That's very sweet.  I will \nsee this movie"
p81
aS'If I robot had story, then this one is like prequel of I robot, when U see, \nhow robots are being intelligent before they are made by all 3 laws.'
p82
aS'so basically I-ROBOT'
p83
aS"Looks like Automata  will be a pirate bay exclusive in sweden. Can't find \nany opening date at any cinema :("
p84
aS'Trailers show too much these days. I had to stop the trailer way before it \nended just to keep the movie from being spoiled or keep from ruining any \nmystery in the movie.'
