p8
aS"We have yet to match in human history the amount of murder and genocide \nthat the Jews went through during the Holocaust. They have every right to \nbe as dramatic as they want. It was awful and anyone who participated in it \nshould be ashamed. It's so inhumane. Torturing children and babies? \nDisgusting."
p9
aS"Lol! You obviously don't know much history if you think that's the first \ntime there was mass genocide, Hell even today mass genocide is happening \nand you don't even care to recognize it because it isn't a country you give \na shit about. Jew's just milk the holocaust and make it seem like it was \nTHE WORST THING TO EVERRR HAPPEENNN! Sure, They sat in unsafe environments \nand was starving but that doesn't prove that 6 million Jews died, that's \nbullshit. I'd say about 250-500 thousand died."
p10
aS"Vel d'Hive was started by the French police, not the Germans. The French \npolice were the ones to take them to the Vel d'Hive, and in my opinion \nmovies about the Vel d'Hiv shouldn't focus on the Natzis, but their own \ngovernment's decision. Take the wool off of the modern French's eyes of \nwhat happened. There's different views of it, of course the Nazis did much \nmore damage, mais quand le franais parle de la Vel d'Hive, je pense que la \nmeilleure approche tait de se concentrer."
p11
aS'@Hamilcar85 u know why they do that to gaza? gaza sent a katyusha attack on \nhiafa.. isreal fought back. and jews werent the only victims but they were \nalot more killed of them then anyone elese'

p18
aS"My point is that we all need to agree that this is something that happened, \nit's something we can never erase from our human history and we need to \ndeal with it. We need to make sure that something like this will never \nhappen again. "

p21
aS'@milliondollarboyd awesome movie...'
p22
aS"First off, I'm not going to even attempt to make a comment on how prime \nyour grammar is. Second off I was never un acknowledging some of the things \nJews did, the only reason I responded to your comment because yours was \nrude and unreasonable. "

aS'What are you doing here, Leon, Professional Killer?'
p24
aS'The whole Hollywood is full of Jews.They do not talk about the crimes in \nPalestine.I am Greek.What about these that nazi did to my country?What \nabout the crimes they are trying to do now in Greece.And they are the \nGermans and the Jews that do these, combined with their friends, \nMasons.FREEDOM TO MY COUNTRY.I will fight.We will fight.You will never take \nanything.  . '
p25
aS"Ok, you all need to calm down. First of all, it's true that Germans are not \nthe only race responsible for a genocide. I actually prefer not to say \nrace, because even the Germans were misguided by one man and his \npropaganda. The peer pressure was enormous. But yeah, there were other \ngenocides in the past, we may not forget that. This was the largest mass \ngenocide in human history as of today, though. It was horrible, just like \nany genocide. "
p26
aS'another jew movie.. *sigh*'
p27
aS'@SubSlaveCD nevermind i get it now. i just clicked your name, saw your \nvideo and almost threw up. la rafle looks like a lovely film.'
p28
aS'@WiredDragoon I agree, as far a films go, the subject matter is not \nparticularly original. But the film does remind us of the horrific acts \ncommitted in the name of ideology. This is not an attempt at \n"guilt-tripping" the German population into admitting the wrongs committed \ntwo generations ago--it is simply an attempt to re-visit an event, whose \npower and influence upon the world can not be denied.'
p29
aS"Want to do a project on this in school and was shocked to hear my history \nteacher had never even heard of the Vel d'Hiv round-up!"

p31
aS'OMG such a good movie, very bittersweet (Y) '
p32
aS'You are all missing the point. This is a remembrance, not a political \nstatement, a historical one that most people have never heard of. Brought \ninto the daylight, we can now remember those who were systematically \ndestroyed. An acknowledgement of lives with value that were cut short and a \nwarning to never let it happen again. Reread some of your own comments and \ninsert Jew where you say Muslimsstart to sound a bit like Hitler. We may \nyet be doomed to repeat history--again in the name of God!'
p33

p38
aS'Jews are so dramatic. Yes, We understand they put you into labor camps and \nkilled off thousands, but come the fuck on. Jew propaganda.'
p39
aS'Yes I am aware of some of the movies that are made, but they are made for a \nreason, sir. To remind the ones who were not there, of the horrors that \nhappened in history, to refresh the minds that we never want to make such a \nmistake again. Because what happened then was something we never want to \nrepeat. And, that last comment you made about the holocaust being a lie; \nwhat are SAYING right now? Please sit down and read a book.'
p40
aS'Another try (film) by the Jews to twist the truth! Hitler was the good guy, \nJews were the criminals, warmongers and evil guys. We all know who lost.'
p41
aS'@661Sunshine WTF, they are not you racist imbecile.'
p42
aS'@SubSlaveCD It is comments like that that are disgusting. If you hate \nmuslims so much then do something about it, rather that bitch like a woman \non youtube'
p43
aS'This "revenge" is actually a pure Neo-Nazism propaganda, which is viewed on \nyour own media channels, and has nothing to do with a simple things called \nREALITY!!! You hpwever, take it as a truth, because you\'re not different \nthen they are. Shame on you!'
p44
aS"@eamanemiriel Actually, if you read what the guy in Norway really wrote, he \nsaid he didn't know if there was a God. He was agnostic. He just said that \nhe felt the Christian governing system was the most successful!"
p45
aS'@WiredDragoon ..yeah, i met a couple, and they were sick of that, as well \nas Christoph Waltz reacting to David Letterman\'s interview question "How \ndid you make the character so evil". I dont think its a "guilt trip" as \nmuch as it is a constant reminder of how fragile things are, particularly \nwith Isreali forces unfairly occupying Gaza. You are correct.'
p46
aS'@trippletrain77 Twenty million Russians, by conservative estimates, have \ndied in the war. Ten million of those were civilians that perished from \nNazi-instituted ethnic cleansing programmes. Even if you count just the \ncivilian deaths, the number is still two million more than estimated Jewish \ncasualties. That is not to dwarf the eight million lives lost to systematic \nslaughter. The constant reminder of the atrocities committed during the war \nshould serve to prevent them from happening again.'
p47
aS'A book written be a jew no ? nazis was the only ones that raise againt jew \ncancer, 100% materialists, whats about the horrors of today of the crisis , \nprovocate by jew system ? whats about the 7 millions of catholics ukranians \nexterminate be russian jews ? and for the 500K womans slaves of east europe \n? Relax, your final day is coming....no one movie cant stop it. '

aS"ive actually done alot of research on the vel d'hiv "
p51
aS'Es evidente que Francia tuvo un papel colaboracionista fundamental para el \nenvi de judos a campos de exterminio; pienso que todo Francs debera ver \nLa Rafle y sentirse culpable por la muerte de miles de judios franceses que \nocupaban roles de medicos, maestros,cocineros,enfermeras, etc al servicio \ndesinteresado y sin cargas raciales en contra de nadie; Francia llevo a la \nmuerte a estas personas sometiendose a un yugo Nazi cuando pudieron haberse \nenfrentado con valor! Viva La Rsistance!'
p52
aS'One of the most original pieces I have every seen. I doubt anyone has \nproduced a similar movie.'
p53

p54
aS'Concentrer..? Sur quoi?'
p55
aS'@661Sunshine Oh, yay another genius with Internet access.... While I don\'t \nargue that what happened was a tragedy, I\'d like to point out that while \nNazis and Hitler were in power in Germany; Italy and Russia were both \nsuffering under fascist/communist parties so don\'t just recite that "Da \nnazis killed da jews, lets shoot da wurlld" "An eye for an eye leaves the \nwhole world blind." - Think about it.

aS"That's not what I said, is it? That it was the first genocide? No. But as \nof today, it is the LARGEST mass genocide in human history at 5.9 million \nmurdered Jews. It is one of the worst things to ever happen, but it doesn't \nmake any other historical genocides any less significant either. Or what's \ngoing on now. And they have paperwork and lists of all Jews who were \narrested by the Nazis or in this case, la police franaise, which cattle \ncars they took to which camps. The only Jews without .."
p62
aS"@SubSlaveCD im not muslim, or jewish or anything at all... but what you \nsaid still ripped through me. A quarter of the world's population is \nmuslim. how can you honestly, and with joy, spread that much negativity and \nhate towards a group of people? "
p63
aS'Before seeing this movie, I believed that German were cruel, hearthless. \nBut, my vision of my country, France, has changed after the movie. I \nnoticed we\'re as cruel as German and, for the first day of my life, I hate \nFrance. For the things french government had made at this time. And, \nHamilcar85, I disagree with you. Unlike you, I think that movie could \nchange the view we could have on Jew. Personally, I admired Jew because of \nthe strength they could have in front of "Barbarians".'
p64
aS"@WiredDragoon ..looks as if we need this whole thing to go down again, so \nthat people will understand how fascism really went down. First, you are \nforce-fed to remind yourself how lucky you are to have civil rights. \nSecond, because no invasion of the U.S has never happened (as Hitler \noccupied Europe) you will never know the fear of people banging down your \ndoor and forcing you into trains. But dont worry you're going to get a \nreminder in a few more years - the real surprise is comin."

p72
aS'@SubSlaveCD Not all muslims are extremists! You can\'t judge an entire \npopulation by the horrible acts of a few nut jobs! A month ago there was a \nterrorist attack in Norway, done by a Christian extremist who decided it \nwas ok to kill innocent people and shoot children in the name of God, not \nAllah or some other God us westerners would call "exotic", does that make \nall of US extremists or trash? Please, take a minute to think about things. \nYour comment only results in even more hate...'

aS"This movie is amazing - it blew me away. I swear I have never seen such a \nsad movie and I've never cried that much to any movie.

p77
aS"Would everyone stop arguing about who's fault it was. This film is about \nreminding 'everyone' what can happen when 'any' system breaks down. I know \nit was a long time ago but we should never never forget. I know there have \nbeen other similar events in Bosnia, Iraq, The Romans etc, but none as \nfocused as this. The film is very powerful drawing the viewer to connect \nwith the characters. 10/10. (If you think we should forget the past then \nyou are worthless person, you don't have to buy it!)"

And if some of you \nwant to deny what happened there, than that's not only your problem, but \nalso ours. Than you are proving that the one man who caused all this is \nstill able to misguide people today from his grave. The thing is, we can \nnever forget what happened there, because it was disgusting and awful to \nsee that the human race is able to do such horrible things. "
p89
