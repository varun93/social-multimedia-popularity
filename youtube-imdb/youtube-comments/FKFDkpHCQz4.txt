S'Recommended Viewing\nHAPPY HALLOWEEN...!'
p1
aS'Literally the worst movie ever made, the acting is hilariously bad and the \nstory speaks for its self, im actually embarrassed for the director. '
p2
aS'This was probably the most terrifying film ive ever seen except Sinister. \nAnd ive seen like all horror films on the planet. Oboy the nightmares ill \nhave tonight '
p3
aS"Bad movie\n\nI've seen it alone in the cinema it was kinda empty like 3 or 4 people was \nthere but i can swear it was like someone behind me pushing the chair \nforward with his legs\n\nit felt so creepy but whatsoever LOL"
p4
aS"Just as good as the original. Don't listen to the butt hurt fanboys. I \nenjoyed the fuck outta' this movie!"
p5
aS'It wasnt a bad movie at all. Still i like the atmosphere and hilarity of \nthe original, it was alot more disturbing amd interesting to watch. This \nwas just a regular horror flick which was pretty good. '
p6
aS'Evil dead without Ash Williams is like Batman without Bruce Wayne'
p7
aS"I think it would be cool if there was an Evil Dead 2. \n\nLike maybe Mia is still in trauma and depressed about what happened to her \nbrother and friends. And like she has a therapist to discuss her problems, \nand she keeps telling the therapist that she has nightmares and visions \nabout what happened in the cabin. So her therapist suggests that she should \ngo back to the cabin to confront her problems/fears. So she does. \n\nI'll let anyone who's reading come up what could happen for themselves. I \njust think it would be cool. :P "
p8
aS'I love this movie'
p9
aS"Would a fan of the original Evil Dead trilogy recommend this i'm kinda \nhesitant to bother with horror remakes given their track record and the \nlack of Campbell concerns me. "
p10
aS'More "gore" then scary, but good movie.\nThe one thing I didnt like was that music (the one they used at the end of \nthe movie)'
p11
aS'This movie was gross not scarey.'
p12
aS'FUCK REMAKES'
p13
aS"another shit remake from hollywood...move along and stick to the original \nbecause no one can play ash better than Bruce Campbell. Honestly there \nisn't anyone who can play ash other than him aside from maybe Robert Downey \nJr or possibly even the late Heath Ledger since both of them have done \nvarying types of serious and comedic roles."
p14
aS'ASH FUCKIN WILLAMS WHERE ARE YOU?'
p15
aS"there's very few evil dead fans that like the original 1981 evil dead \nbetter than evil dead 2 and 3. This movie was made for those specific \npeople. The fans of the original first evil dead. The so called fans that \ncomplain that this was bad just because ash wasn't in it they dont know \nwhat the fuck they're talking about. Same goes for those who say it missed \nthe campy fun from the original again you don't know Shit , Why? because \nthe original was an all serious creepy ass demonic disturbing film and \npurposely fucked up and disturbing. Ash was just a guy like the rest of the \nkids and the movie was not a comedy. So in all regards this remake was ok \nand respectful to the original.  "
p16
aS"Anyone have or know the link to the full movie can't find it anywhere? "
p17
aS"This movie, oh this movie. I haven't seen the original, but if it's this \nstupid and makes just as little sense as this remake, I don't want to see \nit. The movie sucked in all ways. It was more of a nasty as fuck comedy \nthan a horror movie. I laughed like a muthafucka though the whole thing. I \nhighly recommend an actual scary movie. It's so bad I watched it at night \nand I still wasn't scared, and I'm a little ass baby when it comes to any \ntype of scary movie... Very disappointed."
p18
aS"I don't care what people say this is the best horror movie I seen I hate \nthe original one I sucks to me"
p19
aS'old evil dead was great, this well not so, some old movies should be  left \nalone '
p20
aS'Worth pirating?'
p21
aS'funny thing is if I saw a deranged sociopath in the middle of a street i \nwould keep driving straight '
p22
aS"maybe she needs to get laid that's all"
p23
aS"Doesn't look like a bad movie, but that was a bad trailer. Its just random \ncut scenes from the movie flashing after each other. This happens, \naaaaaaand this, this also happens, this happens too, then this, oh also \nthis."
p24
aS"This movie was absolutely amazing. You should watch it if you haven't \nalready .\nBest horror movie in a long long time"
p25
aS'I thought it was pretty great for a reboot. But I\'m disappointed that they \ncut out some scenes from this trailer & the red band trailer. I was really \nlooking forward to seeing Mia sing "we\'re gonna get you" & it never \nhappened. Other than that it wasn\'t bad.'
p26
aS"I dare somebody to watch this movie without saying ''IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE \nTHAT!!!'' every to goddamn minutes!"
p27
aS'dem horror movie trailer clichs do'
p28
aS'I watched this movie last night in the dark.... alone... when I first \nturned to the movie channel it was on I was a bit skeptical but after the \nmovie I went to bed and it gave me freaking nightmares, like holy shit whdn \nI woked up I couldnt get back to sleep so I watched another movie called \nFree Birds, it helped.... a lot'
p29
aS'Sucky ass movie\n'
p30
aS'I personally havent seen the new one yet, but im just curious, do they \nincorporate ash in it aswell, where he looses his hand, then fights the \narmy of darkness?'
p31
aS'I loved it a lot! Very gory and its a creepy ambience all along the movie \nNice'
p32
aS"omg this movey is so bad i cnt even deeeeel with it man shit in ne I'm so \npissed waste 4 dolls on this. shit man,"
p33
aS'I really not sure about this movie. Is this recommended or something? I \nwent to Common sense media and they only show what happen to the OLD movie, \nnot the NEW one. Though, they have the picture of the NEW one.'
p34
aS"Wow it is scary, but I don't like million litars blood, too much blood and \nespecially don't like that they use some sentence from The Exorcist!!!!!"
p35
aS'Evil dead I and II are shit..this is what I call a movie...great job^^'
p36
aS'Ju On is seriously better than this'
p37
aS"The only bad thing is, that so many fucked up things going around even \ntheir friends dieing, and they still think nah she's just ill, some kind of \nflue or smth...like wtf...lol which makes the movie stupid."
p38
aS"Doesn't even look as good as Evil Dead 2"
p39
aS'Imma c dis soon. Watch the trailers with a total straight face.'
p40
aS'This Movie Will Be Banned!!!This Movie Contains high level violence and \nblood, sexual and gore.you know.'
p41
aS'Black person dies first. What a surprise. It pissed me off because she was \nhot as hell too. :('
p42
aS'This was more disturbing than scary....'
p43
aS'Another movie and that goes beyond human limits of survival; overkill of \nblood and gore. There are a few references of the original, but still is \nless than mediocre. Overall this movie should have stayed dead, in a deep \ndeep grave.\n'
p44
aS'This movie is so creepy '
p45
aS'Anybody else here from Marzias video?'
p46
aS"this movie wasn't good without me in it"
p47
aS'Lol'
p48
aS'that jesus looking guy with glasses was the reason for all of this misery \nlol'
p49
aS'I have not seen the movie ,But i HATE the part in the trailer where the \ngirl say`s\n- Where gonna get u , Time to go to sleep\nI mean like , I LOVE horror movies but....that part is just creepy as SHIT \n!'
p50
aS'This kind of reminded me of Cabin in the woods'
p51
aS'I think it is more of a re-imagining than a remake. If it was a remake then \nthere would be no change in plot and characters. Also I really enjoyed this \nmovie the first time i watched it.'
p52
aS'I watched Scary Movie 5 before I watch this movie...\nsuch a big mistake...'
p53
aS'that is stupid'
p54
aS'This movie was scary but it wasent the scariest I ever seen was insidious '
p55
aS'Ive watched it once already but watching it the second time is even scarier \neven though i know whats gonna happen'
p56
aS"People are so fucking two-faced, when this first came out in theaters, \neveryone praised it, now that it's been a full year, everyone hates it and \nis now ranking up there with every other shitty horror movie remake. \nPersonally, I enjoyed the film, it felt like the director was bringing the \n1981 original to today's audience and I think he did an admirable job \ntrying to capture that dark, messily violent atmosphere that the original \n(not the sequels) had. I feel that people didn't like this movie because it \nwasn't like Evil Dead II, the fan favorite. Ash wasn't a one-liner cracking \nmacho hero in the original, he was an ordinary guy who acted quick on his \nfeet like the character David in this movie. Do I think the movie was \nbetter than the originals? Of course not, but I feel that it earned its \ninheritance."
p57
aS'The movie was good but not better than the original evil dead'
p58
aS'I love this movie I enjoyed this movie'
p59
aS'Oh my god! Teeny boppers the best horror films ever made are NOT Rec, The \nConjuring, Paranormal Activity, Saw, Sinister or ANY OF THAT OTHER \nBOLLOCKS!! STFU you are embarrassing yourselfs. Do me a favour right now \nand go and watch The Thing but please be warned you will probably shit in \nyour pants. I actually saw someone say The Woman In Black is scary, how old \nare you people? 10? Jesus where are your parents?!'
p60
aS"LOVE THIS MOVIE! IT'S SO AWESOME!"
p61
aS"I loved this movie but one thing I didn't understand was The Abomination. \nWhat was the point of that? I personally felt that it was just added for \nthat one last fight scene before the film was over. If someone could \nexplain that part, id really appreciate it.....other then that this movie \nwas one of the better horror films to come out in recent memory"
p62
aS'A little predictable '
p63
aS'watch this motherfucker here:\nhttp://putlocker.is/watch-evil-dead-2013-online-free-putlocker-451279.html'
p64
aS'so so'
p65
aS"This was hands down fucking awesome, sooooo gruesome too. 8/10 for me... \nI'm not usually a fan of horrors but this shit had me hyped! Haha"
p66
aS'I love this movie I enjoyed this movie'
p67
aS'this looks like a comedy lmao =^0^='
p68
aS'Fuck'
p69
aS'I only see hate coments but hey! I really liked this movie!!!!'
p70
aS'seems like cabin in the woods for me'
p71
aS'Bruuhh '
p72
aS'The Movie is not scary but the gore is too much'
p73
aS'This movie was gory not scary!\nThis movie was stupid in the sense of the guy with glasses... Some sort of \n50 cent that has a strong resilience to death until the least thing you \nexpect him to die from actually kills him..\n. So many times in the movie I was like " Wtf.. Why is he still alive!?"\nAlso I\'m pretty sure everyone knows that once you hit a main artery in your \nveins you\'re pretty much dead ...\nThe ending was my favourite part because it was just ridiculous.\nThese directors need to have more respect for the viewers and stop feeding \nus garbage!'
p74
aS"For me a very good horror. The story may not be that awesome but it's \ncreepy in which like almost every horror fails these days.. Exorcism and \nhaunted houses are great but cm'on.."
p75
aS'is this a comedy?'
p76
aS'nice'
p77
aS"omg k so my best friend pretty much only watches horror movies. and she \nsaid this was the scariest movie she'd ever seen. and coming from a girl \nwho doesnt get scared very easily, that means its scary af."
p78
aS"that's what ja get when you're brought up in Suburgatory "
p79
aS"It's scary cuz it's nasty if your really sensitive don't watch this"
p80
aS'try watching it without sound and you going to see..that you are wasting ur \nmoney and time to watch this pornography-its toxic '
p81
aS'...Oh, my god. I may never sleep again from this trailer alone. This is \nabsolutely grotesque and unnerving and intense. This has got to be the \ngreatest horror remake ever made and is far better than its original source \nmaterial.'
p82
aS'My friends and I saw this for my birthday a few years ago. Common raining \nblood? It looked like food coloring and watered down corn syrup.'
p83
aS"Looks alright, but once you've seen Event Horizon every other horror movie \nseems kind of tame."
p84
aS"                                      GOD, THIS MOVIE.\nI saw this movie with my friend. I think the scariest part for me was the \ndeer head. DX when I saw that scene, I was soooo SCAREDD! From that part of \nthe movie and on, I was sitting in his lap. XDD Then, the shower scene \nscared the crap out of my friend. since I was sitting in his lap, he almost \nsqueezed me to death. Yeah... I think I'm done with horror movies."
p85
aS'The way the evil girl talks is so funny "come here, bitch."'
p86
aS'This is the remake of the dude that replaces his hand with a chainsaw \nright?'
p87
aS'For "much anticipated", read "wholly unnecessary"'
p88
aS'this movie was fucking insane!'
p89
aS'bruce needs to be in next one'
p90
aS'B U L L S H I T'
p91
aS'This movie scared me to Death.'
p92
aS'i love the original evil dead, the cabin was so cozy, there was something \nspecial about that movie, being filmed in a real cabin in tennesee'
p93
aS'Amazing film better than the original hope it will win an Oscar '
p94
aS"I love this reboot it's even better than the original"
p95
aS"Finally, a remake that doesn't suck. Not only was this film amazing, but I \nfound it better than the original. "
