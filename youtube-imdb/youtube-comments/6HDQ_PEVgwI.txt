S'Hmm. I see Liam Neeson is being a badass per usual'
p1
aS'Taken, Unknown, Non Stop and now this one.'
p2
aS'100 bucks that the guy that hired neeson to find the guys who killed his \nwife is actually the bad guy, too predictable now a days.'
p3
aS'A Walk Among the Tombstones Official Trailer #1 (: \nhttp://youtu.be/6HDQ_PEVgwI'
p4
aS'At first I was a little sketchy as #liamneeson  has been typecast lately, \nbut this one actually looks decent. This looks like a dark thriller that \nputs a veteran detective out of his league when he deals with killers just \nas good at killing as he is at stopping them. This should be worth a view. '
p5
aS'Taken 4 ladies and gents'
p6
aS'Cant tell if sequel to Taken or a completely different movie'
p7
aS'wow... ever since "Taken", Hollywood has a hard-on for Liam shooting guns! '
p8
aS'"Have you dealt with situations like this" "no,not like this" be honest \nLiam we all know you have or have you already forgotten taken?'
p9
aS'The John Wick trailer reminded me that I read a good review about this one: \nhttp://www.outlawvern.com/2014/09/25/a-walk-among-the-tombstones/'
p10
aS"Why show us a major point in the movie? (like one of the suspects killing \nhimself) 'sigh' Some trailers"

p12
aS'Anyone know the little girls name?\n'
p13
aS'Taken 3 is releasing on january 9, 2015. This is not a sequel or similiar \nto Taken series.'

p15
aS'SOOOOOOOOONG PLEASE!! :D'
p16
aS'Next they will make a movie about him trying to find his car\nKeys. '
p17
aS'Is that an alien at 2:22 or am I seeing things differently ?'
p18
aS'"Taken Harder" '
p19
aS"There is reason why Liam Neeson is believable as a bad ass - the guy's a \nfucking giant and and scary.  I saw him in Toronto.  I am not a little guy. \nHe was probably 6'5 or 6'6.  Big enough to cast a shadow that's for sure \nlol.. I wouldn't fuck with him in real life even at his age.."
p20
aS'aw fuck off with all the comparisons to his other movies, so fucking what, \nyou are still going to watch this movie. and it looks like a good fucking \nmovie. '

aS'lol this movie has been made at least four times, all with Liam Neeson. The \nfact that morons still get hyped over this generic and redundant garbage \namazes me. '
p53
aS'Who else thought this was a wolf among us film for a sec'
p54
aS'I thought this was taken 3 before i actually searched it!'

aS'liam neeson. or should i call him badass neeson!'
p87
aS'Carcosa.'
p88
aS"Movie is based on a book by Lawrence Block which came out in the early \n90's.  It was part of the Matthew Scudder series that Block wrote over \nabout a 25 year period.  Movie looks decent, but Neeson is miscast as \nMatthew Scudder."
p89
aS'This movie is very underrated!'
p90
aS'Liam. Neeson Is. A. Joke. '
p91
aS'song is BLACK HOLE SUN - Stella Starlight Trio'
p92
aS"Haven't seen it and don't want to. Reviews tell of men torturing and \nmurdering women - not entertainment in my view. More Hollywood crap to \nfreak people out and make lots of money. The trailer had nothing that would \ninspire me to see it, even if it was free. Who needs all that on their \nbrain? Apparently, someone thinks we need more violence. Yeah, right."
p93
aS'gee let me guess the husband is behind it'
p94
aS"They should've just used the original song lol.. Would've fit better"
