aS"Though I think this trailer is false advertisement - in that it wasn't \nshown in the film -TRON LEGACY was definitely one of Disney's best \nlive-action films in years.... a very worthy sequel to the epic original, \nand it does actually deliver the trailer's hype."
p2
aS'some people say that derezed dude here is Back from Tron Uprising'
p3
aS'Oken'
p4
aS'I love this proof-of-concept video!  Even though I have seen the movie, I \nnever tire of re-watching this video as there are SO many details that one \ncan miss.  To me it is really a work of art created by some very talented \ncraftspeople.  Even the sound effects are worthy of note (e.g. the sound of \nthe leather suit being dragged along the "glass" roadway).  A real treat!'
p5
aS'Some of the Disc Battle fighters were green.'
p6
aS'Muito bacana os efeitos mas o filme  chatssimo!'
p7
aS"Guy which I don't know: you won okay? Its just a game!"
p8
aS'Its on my "to-watch-List". Thx :D Are you on fb? '

p12
aS'Jjjk'
p13
aS"What a fuckin' great movie... :D"
p14
aS"What exactly is the music at the end of this clip? Is it Daft Punk from the \nsoundtrack CD? If so I can't figure out exactly which track."
p15
aS'@mastergradeone The colors were perfect:D The green would have remind us to \nthe 20 years old PCs:D The future is blue, past is green:D'
p16
aS'its just a game '
p17
aS"it's a classic. It's worth a lot."
p18
aS'mean 2010 '
p19
aS"Its funny because this trailer hinted at a lot more than people noticed. \nThe green worn by Clu was a subtle, yet clever, hint at his turning. In the \noriginal story you see Clu is blue, while in the film he is yellow. The \ngreen is actually a subtle transition between the colors as Clu's \nprogramming is slowly corrupted into what he becomes. Thus the colors \nmixing before the dominant yellow takes over. "
p20
aS'ummm quick question when did this happen in the actual movie?'
p21
aS'KH2'
p22
aS'I thought CLU was orange. Just saying.'
p23
aS'@wsomaster you mean Tron 3, cause Tron Legacy actually is Tron 2.'
p24
aS"I didnt know where to ask this...So I'll just ask here When sam flynn first \nmeets his father, you can see kevin's identity disc is white, but at the \nend of the movie when he switches discs with quorra and clu notices ...he \nwatches quorra and you can see her with kevin's identity disc but it's \nblack....so I just wanted to know if it was part of the movie or just a \nmistake or what? sorry for the lame ass question, but I didn't watched the \nwhole movie..."

p29
aS"It wasn't.....that great...Sure the graphic were /pretty/. But it was \nlacking in a good plot. I was honestly disappointed as a Tron fan. The \noriginal is so much better. And it was way before it's time in the cutting \nedge graphics for 1982. Maybe my standards were just too high. I was \nexpecting more that day I walked into the theater. Yet I should have gotten \nmore, Tron is a freaking classic. But, you know, sequels rarely turn out \ngood. I guess Legacy was no exception."
p30
aS'Is there a reason why are their masks different to the movie?'
p31
aS'no joke, In Time is my favorite movie!!!! <3 '
p32
aS'okitnam '
p33
aS"@kyokittychibi Hey, most critics agree with you, the dialogue and \nscreenplay were cheesy and cliche, the whole thing would've flopped if not \nfor Tron's cult fanbase, special effects and that sweet, SWEET Daft Punk \nOST. Without the music and SE? Tron Legacy was shit."
p34
aS'JEFF BRIDGEESS!!!!!! ......oooops sorry wrong video :))'
p35
aS'Can someone tell me if the first Tron is worth watching?'
p36
aS'simply mad about this film really love Tron best ... = *-* = '
p37
aS'Lego'
p38
aS'if you really like this trailer - don`t watch the actual movie'
p39
aS'ok, but you can add me if you prefer, my name is Elsa Lola and I have the \nsame pic like my youtube profil... ;) '
p40
aS'"It\'s just a game!" "Not any more." Chills every time.'
p41
aS'So why did take so long for a sequal?'
p42
aS'"I wonder if tron is any good. Guess I\'ll watch a trailer..." God.. I was \nso naive two minutes and 57 seconds ago....'
p43
aS'Ah. Well what I meant is that this trailer ended up being better than "Tron \nLegacy."'
p44
aS'Bridges seems sadistic'
p45
aS'Epic Madness'
p46
aS'GREAT MOVIE...THE VISUAL EFFECTS...PRECIOUS, LIGHTS, DISEGINS CLOTHES, AND \nALL CONCEPTS. '

aS"@ChaoticRupture Apparently the disc colour (but not the disc's LIGHT \ncolour) matches the outfit being worn. Anytime you see Kevin Flynn wear \nblack (jacket, hooded robe) the disc is similarly coloured to match."
p54
aS'For those of you questioning why this scene wasn\'t in the movie and \nwhatnot, it\'s cuz sometimes movies film a "trailer" befor the film is even \nfinished or has even been made yet,'
p55
aS'The Cyber Epic Movie'
p56
aS'...J Law?'
p57
aS"Are you saying that this trailer was made in the '80s?"
p58
aS"It's like the matrix, it's dark and cool and sort of scary. But it has no \nplot what so ever..."
p59
aS"@Avalanche1530 Funny you say that. Since posting that comment I've actually \nlook into it more and I am now quite keen to see it. I agree that it's not \nthe best trailer for someone unfamiliar with the franchise. "
p60
aS'@spicyd2 I\'m confused, what do you mean? you said "where have you been \nliving all your life? in a cave?" so I assumed you meant like "dude, that \nalready exists... it\'s internet, have you been in a cave?" but what did you \nmean?'
p61
aS'when i first saw this trailer i thought it was that November 09. but it was \nDecember 2012'
p62
aS"you've totally right - the movie is crap, sadly!"
p63
aS'@KAAllitt Download it from torrentpond > isohunt... takes about 12 hours.'
p64
aS'So...when are they coming out with these light cycles??? :D'
p65
aS"@powerrage2151 I don't know- but I like the change. Perhaps these colors \nwere too cool and didn't give the film's palette enough contrast- so they \nchose the powerful complementary contrast instead- which I think works much \nbetter."
p66
aS'Dailymotion\'s got it (temporarily no doubt). Just search "tron legacy next \nday" and it should show up in the first few tiers. It may be a video link. '
