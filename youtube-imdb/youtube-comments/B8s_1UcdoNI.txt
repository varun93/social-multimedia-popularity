S"It's 2014 and people still believe in God and the devil? Pretty sure \nscience has already proven they are just old fairytales. All these comments \nmust be made from Americans."
p1
aS' Well in the bible it is stated that the snake is a sign of The Devil. \nHence Voldamort. Since he has horns and is gaining the powers of Saten, he \nis able to control snakes. So everybody who is saying, "there are snakes \nbecause he stared in Harry Potter" you\'re wrong. It\'s because of LUCIFER'
p2
aS'*Horns*\nThis was surprisingly fun and interesting. It is a murder mystery with \nsupernatural dark humor.  \n\nRated R for violence and language.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/B8s_1UcdoNI\n\n#horns   #danielradcliffe   #movies  '
p3
aS"I find it ironic people quoting the bible to condemn a fictional story. \nIt's not like their fantasy is better or more righteous than another \nfantasy because none of it actually exists.  \n---\nWhy are humans so caught up about it? It's just a story, and it's not like \nany of this snake-evil-devil-god-bible thing will actually ever happen \nbecause none of it exists. Can't people just take it for what it is? \nDoesn't it seem silly, in the end? Read the bible for yourself - it's so \nfull of holes and self-contradictions you may as well be conducting an \nautopsy on Swiss Cheese. "
p4
aS'illuminati illuminati illumnati devil satan etc everywhere! satan please \nstop.. *sigh*'
p5
aS"*I like Daniel Radcliffe. I don't care that he's Gay. I think he's a good \nactor*"
p6
aS'Is anyone else concerned about the Devil themes running around in movies \nthese days?'
p7
aS'So, this horn thing comes accompanied by a gift to make people confess \ntheir sins. Seems like devil and angel boundaries are somewhat mixed up. \nMakes me want to read the book and see the movie. Sold.'
p8
aS'Holy shit he sounds so different now O.O'
p9
aS'someone explain to me in detail why satan is a bad thing. i want to know'
p10
aS'Oh no...the main character has horns in a movie.....THE WORLD IS GOING TO \nIMPLODE OMG THE HORROR PROTECT THE CHILDREN SOCIETY IS FUCKED \nNOW....because....because...HORNS! HOOOOOORRRRNNNNSSSS! IT BURNS! IT BURNS!'
p11
aS'Potter with Horns? Hope to see the movie also in german theaters'
p12
aS"where is his british accent? I love him he is a great actor! I'm super \nexcited for this movie when is the premiere?"
p13
aS'Would be cool if you got horns, they are very stylish ;) Image women \nwalking around with gloss-pink horns, or men with matte-black horns, it\'d \nbe a new fashionable item! :D These days the only horns that grow on human \nare nails... Nails are cool too, but it\'s not very "woah! I like what you \ndid with your nails!", Horns, however, CAN be customized. You can make them \nsharp, carve some cool patterns into them, paint them in different colors, \nmake John Snow\'s sword pummel into them, you can even make them look like \nchess pieces if you\'re into that! And they\'re on your head, so everybody \nsees them! ( except the blind... ) The market would go wild for \nHornSocks(c), GoogleHorns(c), or the new iHorn(c) ( in blue and black )! \nAnd that\'s only western culture, in the less-rich countries they would have \na practical use, like breaking coconuts or holding things stable on your \nhead :) Maybe some pretty things to attract the ladies/men! Horns are \namazing ;D'
p14
aS'Ok ok Daniel we get it......you are a legion of demons inside that human \nbody. So what? Your anti-Christ still a loser, and is gonna burn in the \nlake of fire at the end anyways and you too, oh and lucifer too. '
p15
aS"It's a little humorous to hear Daniel Radcliffe with an American accent. \n Movie looks good though."
p16
aS'This is kinda horny... }:P\n\n#horns  '
p17

p19
aS'10 POINTS TO GRYFFINDOR!!!'
p20
aS"wow that's odd, looks good"
p21
aS"I find it very sad that movies like these are being produced. Humanity have \nturned away from God, from the genuine spirituality that connects us to the \nsource. Evil appears regularly in movies these days, making especially \nyoung people to fall in love with the evil characters of the movie. \nUnfortunately people are unconscious to realize the fact how subliminal \nmessages works. This is exactly what the Illuminati want. To kneel before \nthe evil demon and obey him instead of turning to Jesus, the channel to the \nlight. To answer the question to one of the comments posted, yes people in \n2014 still believe in God and Satan. They exist even if you don't believe \nin them. Sadly the group of people who worships the wrong one, successfully \nmanages to brainwash most of people today in not believing in anything \nanymore. Science is Satan's tool, Meditation is God's. If people would \nreach a high level of awareness, they would be able to see through the dark \nsymbols this movie is trying to bury deep into the conscience of people. \nYou fall in love with darkness and violence and you don't even know it! \nSadly, you actually think that this movie is funny. Well, it's not. It's an \nabomination and very disrespectful for the purity of the human soul. I will \ncertainly skip watching this garbage. I merely stumbled here by accident. \nOr maybe not since i was able to post this message for those who might \nposses enough wisdom to see what forces are working all throughout this \nmovie. God Bless Everyone! :)"
p22
aS"as a followup\nremember that harry potter fanfiction.net series a while ago featuring the \nconcerned mother wishing to write a more 'Christian' version of the books?\n\ni found her reasoning for that\nHorns Official Trailer #1 (2014) - Daniel Radcliffe, Juno Temple Movie HD"
p23

aS'when will it come out? or has it?'
p25

p33
aS'What happened to his British accent?'
p34
aS"It's not the devil part that has everyone enraptured. It's the fact that \nDan was able to lose his accent :D"
p35
aS'I need some help - anyone can tell me exact prices, or atleast average, of \nthe prices in theatres for hollywood movies? You know, I need the ones from \nusa releases, and other. I know this is off topic, but theres something im \nworking on. so,. once again, I need average prices of these movies in \ntheatres in certain countries'
p36
aS'now this open devil worshiping is becoming frustrating...'
p37
aS'Funny all the people saying stuff about the bible.  The bible is as real as \nSnow White and the Seven Dwarves.  '
p38
aS"I think you're all idiots. For multiple reasons. One, this is fiction. Two, \nyou obviously know nothing about what God had actually instructed us to do \nand not to do on this world, proven by your ignorant statements. Three, if \nyou knew what God had said about the world and where it would go, you'd \nknow that there is no stooping it, and it is only a bad sign for the damned \nones, for the rest, it's your ride home, to Heaven, forever. And with your \njudgments you're probably damning yourselves. There is a reason that there \nwill only be 200000 seats available by the end times. Thank you all for \nopening a few up!"
p39
aS"i realy hate this movie its full of shit ... now they want us to say devil \ncan be good and they Defending the one ho want all humans to be in hell \n.... but what u don't know that satan have no power on us he only Tempted \nus to do Sins .... satan never was an angel he was some thing else ... and \nrealy guys u must know what the real power of your own maker Enough \nignorance god is the only one ho Worthy of worship ...he don;t have a wife \nnor son as you think .. God is perfect and great and wise everything in the \nheavens and the earth belongs to him as every thing we know about and we \ndon't know wake up people "
p40
aS'funny that people wont believe in God nowadays,  but everyone believes in \ndevil!'
p41
aS"you believe God is a fairy tale Science proved there is no God How so \nscience is greater than the creator there is no disputing God to that he \ndoes not exist is to suggest man created himself or came from thin air God \nis everything knowledge love spirit if I'm wrong about believing in the \nLord a Heaven and a hell and by some very, very small chance it isn't true \nI have nothing to lose but if I am right and I'm not trying to be cause God \nis right then those that do not believe lets just say there is no ice water \nthere"

p45
aS"You're a demon, Harry."
p46
aS'His acting was still great but... that movie was just incredibly bad! Damn! \n:P Usually I like a good devil story (was hoping for something like that) \nbut this just felt like a fairy tale for bible thumpers...'

p49
aS'lol '
p50
aS'Saw it and LOVED IT!!!'
p51
aS'Epic harry potter'
p52
aS'if you think about it religion is important to science because Science and \nreligion generally pursue knowledge of the universe even if they both are \nusing different methodologies. Science acknowledges reason, empiricism, and \nevidence, while religions include revelation, faith and sacredness. Despite \nthese differences, most scientific and technical innovations prior to the \nScientific revolution were achieved by societies organized by religious \ntraditions. how about you go to a church service and maybe read heven is \nfor real then come tell us that science is the only answer'

aS'I totally dig Daniel Radcliffe in fantasy/supernatural movies, so this \nappears to have some nice potential...\n\nHowever I can only hope the movie is clever and engaging instead of clichd \nand boring, because a vast majority of these recent "devil" and \n"supernatural" and "poltergeist/possession" movies are horrible and stupid.'
