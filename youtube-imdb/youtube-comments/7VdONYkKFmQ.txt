aS'"Fight for humanity! " was the last speech'
p5
aS'The second this film tried to pass off sub-Saharan Africans as Greeks, I \ncouldn\'t take this revisionist crap seriously anymore.  That pretty much \nkilled it for me.  The movie itself was pretty lame anyway and it was full \nof miscast actors, but trying to pass off Africans, Indians, Mulatto and \nother obvious non-Europeans as Europeans is both inaccurate and insulting. \n This felt more like that god-awful "Thor" crap, complete with \n"multicultural" Valhalla, than anything even remotely resembling Greek \nMythology.  As usual, Hollywood bastardizes European mythology to suit the \nfalse God\'s of "multiculturalism".  '
p6
aS"People complain its not historically accurate. You want accurate? Watch a \ndocumentary. This is entertainment. It doesn't surprise me though. People \nthink 12 Years a Slave, Zero Dark Thirty, Inglorious Bastards, and other \nsimilar propaganda films are real. "

p18
aS'Atenea is so beautiful!'
p19
aS'Big shit ever'
p20
aS'1'
p21
aS"It's a lame version of 300. Before you say 300 is history and this is \nmythology; Clash of the Titans is a better mythology movie"
p22
aS'Saw the movie, best sword fighting one ever made. And even though I am 11. \nI was never scared. Just encouraged to be brave. And to never fear. Weather \nGohsts,demotic energy, never fear. Love this movie.'
p23
aS"lol. This movie sucks balls.\nJust watched it. The story sucks so much after 25 min I started just \nskipping through quickly to get only the battle scenes.\n\nBut even then.. By the end I witnessed one of the worst battle scenes ever. \nFirst the hero's speech to the troops is a fucking joke. 2nd, when they \nstart running to meet the ennemy army, lol... I'm actually still laughing \nat this. slow motion kicks in, super low bass kicks in, and then??.. like 3 \nguys from the ennemy armie come in.. then like.. 3 more guys... wow... But \nthat's not all. Then the hero keeps running forward through the ennemy \ntroops in a fucking 6 meters wide tunnel. One more look at the ranks now \nfucking 30 meters behind him? complete void, still a couple more guys \nrushing in.\n\nfucking 20 years ago Brave Heart was able to have fucking epic battle \nscenes with armies clashing into each others. And now we have this.. I'm \nhappy I didn't sit my ass on a theater for this fiasco of a movie. Saw it \non Netflix. Now I know why it was available so fast. thing just sucks."

p30
aS'Oh my god - this is like God Of War :D'
p31
aS"Who in the fuck would watch a movie where  the writers just picked up a \nGreek Mythology textbook and copied it as their script? Do you have any \nidea how much shit those writers and producers would get? None of these \nGreek Mythology movies are supposed to be 100% accurate. It's way more \ninteresting when they get creative."

aS"The greek Gods portrayed here look so gay! This isnt even the true story of \nTheseus. And Hyperion is a titan not a mortal king''"
p41
aS'i expected this film to be mediocre.Yet it proved me wrong,being very \ngood.Not as good as 300 ,but still  it was great!10 times better than Thor \nand Thor 2.And Mickey Rourke rocks!!'
p42
aS'cant remember any more badly directed film...everything looks fake..'
p43
aS"Greek gods aren't just stories, most of the time a god stands for something \nthat we can not wrap our heads around. Like a complex idea, which we \notherwise could not give meaning. We give it a story and then it makes \nsense, for a little. \n\nTake phylosophy, most complex ideas about (for example) 'time' never have a \nfinite answer. Because there is none, by telling a story you just make it \nmore understandable, even if the answers are never found.\n\nWhen we look at this movie, and at all the things that are in-correct, all \nthose ideas go to waste and you are left with nothing, the story becomes \nflat because it doesn't challenge the watcher to perceive it in their own \nway. ( with other words it doesn't make you think about all the \nposibilitys, that greek gods and myths have ). The CGi might be good, but \nthe movie industry has to be reminded of that CGi is not everything. Most \npeople value an intruiging story with mind bending ideas and twists way \nmore. That is what makes TV shows like Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones so \npopular, these shows have been put together so well that people like to \nthink of what is going to happen next finding all of their ideas thrown to \nbits when the opposite happends. \n\nWhen a movie does this, that just means the producers think their audience \nis stupid.\n\nHope I made a little bit sense.\n\nPeace"

p50
aS'Haha I am a licenced archer but I\'m sure everyone who sees that pretty \n"modern" bow could get that there is no way, no way that such a bow existed \nnearly 3000 years ago... Such a shame; if you basically paint the very \namateur wooden bow into golden color, you can get it.'
p51
aS'movie kinda sucked...but you have to agree, the fight with the titans was \npretty badass'

p57
aS"Yeah, this movie was stupid, but come on. It's a Tarsem Singh movie. Of \ncourse it's gonna be more focused on mind blowing bizarre visuals than \nstory. I knew exactly what I was getting, and I liked it."
p58
aS"don't know why they chose thesius why not Kratos"
p59
aS'felt kinda short. The buildup at the beginning was good but afterwards, it \nwent down and plotholes started to arrive.'
p60
aS'Kinda sad lol, kids and teens these days buy all this crap in a second.. \nHistory Mythology folklore... everything gets distorted once it gets \nsnatched by hollywood.... "yes fk norse mythology! Thor is a DC universe or \nmarvel character...and its better cause its american!" I mean they don\'t \nmake movies based on myths and history they make movies based on someone\'s \ncrappy picture(comic) book with 3 sentences in it and then they give it \n(for example) a title with historical connotation "300" ...'

aS'Joseph Morgan <333'
p76
aS'too much green screen :/'
p77
aS'I doubt the producers will (as most of you put it) stop screwing Greek \nMythology or any mythology for that matter. You think they dont know they \nare removing and adding stuffs to it? But it boils down to what the \nconsumers want and like; what makes them tick (even I chuckle at the \naforementioned) but its how it is. The consumer wins all the time or most \ntimes just not the ones on here. Evidently! :P Be that as it may, isnt it a \nwonderful thing that we have a choice to walk away even if it is in silent \nacquiescence..? I think its priceless! '
