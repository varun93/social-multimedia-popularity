S'its sad how batman films have changed...they\'re all special effects and \nthat\'s it..i really dont get it how people see this movie as \n"brilliant"...and i talk about all 3 of them. can the atmosphere of the old \nfilms be compaired to this? heath ledger had just 1 role, he played epicly \nand that\'s it. there is no dark feeling to the movie or something that \nmakes you gooshbump...its like i watch an other action movie,nothing really \nspecial except the joker role but 1 role is far from making the movie \ngood...i really dont get people that votting for the trilogy as the best \nbatmans...'
p1
aS"Brilliant movie. Loved it. It's a pity that Ledger didn't have more screen \ntime "
p2
aS'Lol, just noticed he laughs like Chucky.'
p3
aS'Agarre al caballero blanco y lo rebaje a nuestro nivel'
p4
aS'R.I.P Heath Ledger'
p5
aS"6 years later, and I'm still on youtube watching the trailer! What a great \nmovie!"
p6
aS'Heath <3'
p7
aS'Oh man nothing will beat that "Holy shit" moment when I first saw the \nJoker.'
p8
aS"It's so upsetting that I still haven't seen this\n"
p9
aS'one of the most overrated shit ever made '
p10
aS"Heath Ledger took a villain and made him real. When you look at other \nadaptations of this character you can easily see that he is a comic book \nvillain, I look at this joker and I don't see that comic book style, I see \na maniac brought to life."
p11
aS'You know that Heath was a bad ass joker when he took the spotlight of this \nfilm!!!'
p12
aS'This entire trailer was dominated by joker as though the film title is\nJOKER:THE DARK KNIGHT..'
p13
aS"Although I am a Marvel fan boy ,i still think this is the BEST Comic-book \nMovie ever made. Avengers makes a close second, but Heath ledger's Joker is \nso Legendary, the only movie i've ever brought on Blu-ray."
p14
aS'If anybody would like to see the lego version look up the dark knight \ntrailer lego bat man. Ok!'
p15
aS"can't wait for superman vs batman and avengers 2 in 2015"
p16
aS'1:55 epic '
p17
aS"It's one of these movies which had a villain more loved than a hero. I \nrefuse to watch other Batman movies, b'cause there are no Joker any more :("
p18
aS'Every now and then, I come watch this video and reminisce about the day I \nnearly shat my pants.'
p19
aS'"Why So Serious" - Joker -'
p20
aS"really want to watch this movie again...... but never goes on sky movies \nanymore just Batman begins and Dark knight rises over and over..... Heath \nledger's acting was superb and story was dramatic and suspending.... BATMAN \nFTW :D "
p21
aS'The Empire Strikes Back is everything a serious sci fi fantasy movie should \nbe. This film brings that same clout. It\'s what a realistic Super Hero/ \nVillain movie should be. The Joker felt genuinely dangerous in this \nversion. Just my opinion however. In other news, I had the hardest damn \ntime finding the correct way to spell the word "realistic" sometimes I \nthink our language is damn quirky.... If you type something wrong a \ninternet troll pops out of your behind to condescend you so I wanted to \navoid something like that.'
p22
aS'chicagoooooooo '
p23
aS'half the clips in this wernt even used in the finished movie'
p24
aS'best movie ever'
p25
aS'I first saw this when I was 12 years old. Holy shit it was intense back \nthen. And its still intense 6 years later. This will go down in history as \nnot just a one of best superhero movies, but one of the best movies ever. '
p26
aS'one of my fav superhero movie of all time and it will remain in my top 5 \nfav superhero movies list for long time'
p27
aS'i hope batman kicks supermans ass'
