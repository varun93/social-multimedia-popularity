p28
aS'I watched the movie yesterday, and I got really confused, because the \nentire relationship in the mishima family was totally different from the \nversion I know from the video game. And Heihachi looks ridiculous. I mean, \nhe is way to skinny, compared to the game.'
p29
aS'OMG! Naruto Shippuden Killer Bee?? XD 1:35'
p30
aS'why would you all want to just watch the same thing over again. cgi would \nhave just been the same damn thing over again.it hard to turn a cgi video \ngame or tv show to a live action movie, they prob wanted to reinvent the \ndamn thing, and im a huge ass tekken fan so stop whining like a little \nbitch, just like the immortals movie they totaly reinvented the story of \nthe gods and made them more human like and i love the shit out of it. \npeople like you guys who cry and whin are not true tekken fans '
p31
aS'Who did they get to play Raven? '
p32
aS'what are you talking about? there are tons of mixed/brazilian/black female \nactors with a typical american accent and what exactly do accents have to \ndo with it anyway?

p58
aS'I played most of the "Tekken" games, and I\'ve heard some good things about \nthis movie, well not from mainstream Critics, but some people actually said \nthis was a good movie. I still think "Tekken:Blood Vengeance" will be way \nbetter, I mean, what other game movies will include Ling Xiaoyu and Alisa \nBronsconovich flying on the back of Panda!?! Also this movie won\'t be as \ngood as "Mortal Kombat".'
p59

And there's a scene of sex! What the fuck \nis going on? They're crushing every beautiful game with those fucking films!"
p65
aS'just a random movie, and a random plot with the character names and \nlikeness of the Tekken franchise. throw in the word "Tekken" every 5minutes \nand bam. u have "Tekken" movie. and a love interest that makes 0 sense. \npretty happy i didn\'t finish watching it.'
p66
aS"Man, its a really cool movie ! I've got the movie. Nice babes in it too ! XD"
p67
aS'Because its more like Mortal Kombat, doesnt make it a shit movie, Imo it \nwas worth watching'

aS"@RealFutureStar33 and not only tekken is become stupid with this films, we \nthink about dragonball (with dragonball evolution they crushed all the true \nstory, goku goes in a college, bulma hasn't blue hairs, and master roshi is \nan old freak man without his shell and his famouses glasses! and we not \ntalked either about piccolo...) and other beautiful games and mangas! they \nreally don't know how to spend that money, it was better to give them to \nthe poor people in hospitals... how stupid."
p72
aS"Accent is really important.Cuz it would suck more.Cristie montiero isn't \nblack anyways.And this one was probably cheap to have in the \nmovie(relatively)."

p89
aS"I liked it. Got it for $15 on Blu-Ray after buying Source Code and I \nenjoyed it in the same way that I enjoy other popcorn films. It isn't a \ncheap movie (35 million) at that amount it cost more than Evil Dead \n1,2,AoD, and Crank 1,2, combined. And it shows also I like the setting far \nmore then the Tekken games these days."
p90
aS'Why must they do this to us?!?!?! =('
p91
aS'guys this is the trailer of x-men first classs... not tekken '
p92
aS"to making the film based the video game. The film maker must love and know \neverything about the character in that video game. I really disappoint they \ncan't make the story and character like the video game. sad..... jun, \nheihachi and kazuya in this movie really different with the video game. \nlara croft - tomb raider and mortal kombat is better than this. :( "
