p41
aS'"Right now i can hardly breathe..." So, why do you sing perfect?'
p42
aS'Umm... No? Yes, Troy is a popular basketball player. But it\'s very clear \nthat Gabriella is NOT popular. Throughout the entire movie, she has about \ntwo friends, Troy and Taylor. Of course, at the end everyone\'s all friends \nbecause of the cheesy, "We\'re All In This Together" scene. As the series \ngoes on, Gabriella becomes popular, simply because she\'s a nice person and \nher boyfriend is popular; his friends become hers. But if you think THAT \nwas the point of the movie... You missed it.'

aS"HSM a good movie? Psh. That's funny. High School musical is a horrible \nmovie because it is overglamourized and overrated. This movie teaches \npeople that they HAVE to be popular and that they HAVE to give a shit about \nwhat popular students in high school say. Well, as we older folk know, \npopular kids end up being brainless, spineless, talentless excuses for \nhuman beings with shitty lives who can't hold on to relationships or even a \njob at a fast-food restaurant. Nice going, Di$ney!"
