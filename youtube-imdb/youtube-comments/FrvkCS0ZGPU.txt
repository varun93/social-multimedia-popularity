p4
aS'Would i be spoiled if i learnt the history of steve jobs?'
p5
aS'I honestly did not think Ashton pulled off the character too well. I \nthought the guy who played Jobs in Pirates of Silicon Valley did much much \nbetter.'
p6
aS'LIKE IF YOU HEAR MACKLEMORE! :3'
p7
aS'This movie sucked so much I wanna see Leo Di Caprio play Steve. Leo should \nget a oscar and Steve should get the movie he deserves '

p20

p26
aS'I say anyone who is a fan of Apple will like this movie'
p27
aS'It is a horrible movie about an awseome person...'
p28
aS"This movie took me on a journey, and not just any journey, the true journey \nof the Apple company and it was truly remarkable and personally I think \nAshton did an excellent job in his role of Steve and apparently this is a \nvery debatable matter but this movie isn't purely for entertainment, it's \ntelling a story. \n\nI think people are wasting too much passion on debating on whether or not \nSteve Jobs is over rated, let's just enjoy the movie and if not, then \nsimply watch other movies. For those who haven't seen this movie i \nrecommend you to watch it with an open mind and I hope you enjoyed it as \nmuch as I did."
p29
aS'Hmm..after watching the movie..i realised that steve jobs aint exactly a \ncreator.he just takes from someone and redesigns.he is more of a \nsalesperson.'
p30
aS'618 fanboys. android and windows'
p31
aS"Steve Jobs didn't actually create anything, did he? I'm not an Apple fanboy \nso I don't know much about his background or how he shot to fame, but it \nseems like he was a great motivator and entrepreneur more than \nanything...so instead of glorifying and shining the spotlight on him, they \nshould have also given credit to the real inventors, the people \nbehind-the-scenes at Apple who turned his vision into reality. seems like \nKutcher did a good job with the movie though, judging from the trailer.  "
p32
aS'Steve Jobs is not a computer genuis he didnt do squat for the community he \nis just a hipster business man who was able to successfully exploit the \nconsumers with over-priced, over-hyped and well advirtised products. Make \nit right Hollywood make a movie about Richard M. Stallman a true PC genuis \nand revolutionary.'
p33
aS'Worse movie ever'
p34
aS'After watching every episode of That 70s show, Im really not used to Ashton \nKutcher playing a smart person.'

aS'Ok Bill gates.Its your turn now,die soon so we can watch your movie'

aS'This movie was terrible.'
p37
aS'this film is very inspiring and emotional if u watch it all the way to the \nend'
p38
aS'sorry was bill gates'
p39
aS'The movie was ok. If it was accurate Jobs certainly was a visionary. But \nwas ultimately a prick that completely screwed his friends and anyone \naround him out of anything he could. Starting with the Apple I which he \nstole from Wozniak. (not to mention the bit where he only gave Wozniak $350 \nfor Breakout. Which was supposed to be half, when he actually got $5,000.) \nMaybe "stole" is a strong word. But from what I gathered he took the Apple \nI (which Wozniak INVENTED) and built his throne on it and ran Wozniak over \nwithout care when Wozniak should have stayed right at the top with Jobs. \nThen he completely screwed all of his friends and co-founders out of being \nshareholders. I hate to say it but the movie didnt really leave a good \nimpression for Jobs. I actually think less of him now then I did before I \nwatched the movie.. Imo he was really a horrible person (provided the movie \nwas accurate). Incredible visionary but as far as just a general human \nbeing and the way he treated people was just wrong. The movie gave the \nimpression that he saw someone else\'s idea improved it a little and sold it \nas his. It shows this with the part at the computer parts store.. the guy \nthat bought the Apple I wanted a plug and play personal computer. So Jobs \ntook his idea and used it. Then it showed this again with Macintosh. He had \nnothing to do with it. They told him the direction they were going with \nMacintosh (an easy to use computer for anyone) You could almost read his \nmind after he was told that (man what a great idea) then he started pushing \ntheir idea. The movie doesn\'t show anything was his idea ever. Yet he \npretty much claimed everything as his.\n\nThen again anyone can say I want the seemingly impossible and push a team \nof people til they get it. That is another thing I got from this movie... \n(again if it is accurate or not missing anything too important) Jobs didn\'t \nreally ever create anything. At least not in the movie. He just knew what \nhe wanted and pushed the people under him (which were terrified of him) \nuntil they got what he wanted done.... not exactly creation.'
p40
aS'For some reason I\'d like to see a sequel to this called "gates" or \nsomething like that. It would basically be this but instead of Steve Jobs \nand Apple it would be Bill Gates and Microsoft. I think that would be cool.'
p41
aS'Straight to VHS'

aS'same here bro'
p47
aS"They'd edit shots and leave out crucial information of whatever event they \nare reporting before they publish them."
p48
aS"You should watch Pirates of the Silicon Valley, it's the story of how Steve \nJobs and Bill Gates met and became partners, two computer titans, that's \nfreaking cool!"

p57
aS'Loved the legendary COMMODORE computers logo :)'
p58
aS"What's the name of the song at 1:30? I actually like it\n"
p59
aS'Not a bad movie at all, but it just feels like something youd watch \nstraight-to-cable. With an Icon as huge as Steve Jobs, I think a better and \nmore thoughtful movie should have been made to honor his legacy. No \nKutchner was not the problem either, he perfectly showcased the \nexcenctricity of Jobs. Its just that it really could have used a much \nskillful director and a better script.'
p60
aS'Alguien que me pueda decir el nombre de la cancin a 1:34? De antemano \nmuchas gracias'

aS'a FICTIONAL account of steve jobs played by a crappy actor for apple fanboy \nfags who do not like the truth'
p66
aS'Steve Jobs is the great person.he is a genius and crazy man who really \nchanged the world by his apple.'
p67
aS"Here's to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels... because the people who \nwhere crazy enough who think they can change the world, are the ones who \ndo."
p68
aS"The movie doesn't detail Steve's life very well, doesn't characterize the \ncharacter well, isn't powerful at all, the writing and directing is crap, \nand Ashton Kutcher has the looks, but he can't play Jobs, and has a Razzie \nnod to prove it. He was miscast despite his preparation."
p69
aS' They need to make a follow-up. Call it "Apple II". It should be about his \nlife during the period Apple revolutionized the way we use technology in \nthe year 2000+. I prefer Apple\'s competitors (Samsung/Microsoft) out of \npersonal preference, but I immensely respect how he revolutionized the way \nwe use technology today (Phones/tablets/laptop design), and the movie \ncompletely ignores Apple\'s peak as a company. I would very much like to see \nit.'
p70
aS'eh. movie was ok/'

aS'So, a white thug is a genius?'
p76
aS"i'm pretty sure apple's success actually came from buying rights for \nsoftware off microsoft."
p77
aS'Worst movie I have ever seen in my life. Jobs is even more terrible than \nSpring Breaks. The problem with this film is that it is NOT factual nor \nentertaining. Its like the director of Jobs wrote the script off something \nhe read off Wikipedia, word for word. '
p78
aS'Steve \nJobsJonathan \nIve"i"'
p79
aS'great trailer, crappy movie'
p80
