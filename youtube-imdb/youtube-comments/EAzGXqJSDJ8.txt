aS"To anyone who is confused about the ending, here. (Spoilers)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the start of the games, some tributes were rebels and had a plan so \nthat Katniss (The Mockingjay), could escape the arena and so could the \nother surviving rebels. Enobaria, Wiress, Beetee, Finnick Odair, Mags, Male \nMorphling, Female Morphling, Johanna Mason, Blight, Chaff, and Seeder. They \nprotected Katniss, some sacrificed their lives so Katniss could escape. \nThen, at the end, Brutus and Enobaria (Enobaria pretended to try to kill \nthem) found them and tried to kill them. Johanna, making sure Katniss would \nescape, hit Katniss in the head and cut out her tracker (A tracker is \ninserted before the games so the gamemakers know where you are) and then \ntried to take on Brutus. Katniss ran back to the tree to get Peeta but he \nwasn't there. Then he saw Beetee shocked by te forcefield but he was alive \nand then she saw him holding a log with metal, trying to destroy the arena. \nSo Katniss decided to destroy the arena herself with her bow and arrow and \nshot the forcefield when the lightning struck, the forcefield was destroyed \nand the arena began to burn, then a hovercraft containing Haymitch \nAbernathy and Plutarch Heavensbee, both rebels, took Katniss, Beetee and \nFinnick who all had their trackers cut out to District 13, an underground \ndistrict that was the head of the secons rebellion. Brutus was killed by \nPeeta, and then the remaining rebellious tributes in the arena who had \ntheir trackers were taken by the Capitol as prisoners to be tortured. The \nCapitol then took Annie Cresta, former victor from District 4 and Finnick's \nlover to be tortured with the other rebels, so the Capitol could have all \nthe rebellion's loved ones. Hope this helped!"

aS"Here's how I came across the Hunger Games. Seeing a little bit of the blue \nsuit I decided to investigate what the world was. So I researched it and \ndiscover it is a story. And so I thought, this is dystopian fiction, was \nreally attracted to Suzanne Collins. I recall thinking the book and the \ncostumes were brilliant. And the characters stuck in your mind long \nafterwards..."
p38
aS'i didnt expect 7 hours !! only many things, important things were modified \nin an extreme that changed in certaing ways the way of the movie. but it is \nimpossible to bring to the big screen one story that is narrated in first \nperson, i know that, I dont expect all the details in specific, but, i \nwould like that the director and the dialogue writer respect the important \nthings in the story,. '
p39

p57
aS'"Last year was childsplay" WTF? She nearly died '
p58
aS'The high-pitched way Prim says "Katniss" for the second time never ceases \nto anger and annoy me. It (unfortunately) brings me back to reality when I \nwas previously sucked into the world of the trailer and of Panem. It\'s so \ngrating on the ears I cannot stand it. It\'s almost comedic how bad the \nactress is in that scene. God. This sounds like an overreaction now that I \nread it back to myself but it\'s something I can\'t help but be enraged by.'
