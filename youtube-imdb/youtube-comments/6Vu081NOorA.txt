S'Amazing movie!!! I loved it!!!\nWhat happens if we use 100% of our brain? Is the mankind ready for this? \n#scarlettjohansson #lucymovie #morganfreeman  '
p1
aS'elfen lied? XDD'
p2
aS'LOOKS \nSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO \nEPIC!'
p3
aS'Actually in recent discoveries we humans do use our entire brain at 100% \nBUT NOT all at the same time. There are many many statements and theories \nthat scientists have disapproved for example the left side of our brain \ncontrols the right side of our body is NOT true at all. Im no geek or \nscientist but i do my own research. Alot of what media says is opposite of \nthe truth or made up shit. '
p4
aS'BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'
p5
aS'6 simple words, FAKE OVER DRAMATIC STUPID ASS MOVIE'
p6
aS'is this on DVD yet?  It looks darn good'
p7
aS'GUYS..\n\nFreeman\'s "quote" was stating that human\'s use 10% of our brain\'s \nPOTENTIAL. Yes we\'re using 100% of our brain no need to go apeshit. But the \nfact is our brain has a lot of undiscovered potential that has yet to be \nrevealed, if it is ever to be revealed.'
p8
aS'!!!!!!!!!!!! Imagine that, YOU unlock Full brain capacity .... !!!!!!!!!!!\n \n(it\'s a little violent movie & similar concept of "the matrix" trilogy)'
p9
aS"I just saw this movie and it's beyond stupidity most parts of the movie. \nEven if it was for a person to have the ability to use 100% of their brain, \nthings wouldn't happen they way it's presented in this piece of non sense \nrubbish.\nThe movie makers clearly didn't use much logic\nIt's one of those movies that is going to make you regret the time wasted \nwatching it."
p10
aS'Mehhhh.....at some times her character reminded me of Alice from Resident \nEvil, but the movie...i will not watch it again'
p11
aS'!!!!!!!!!!!! Imagine that, YOU unlock Full brain capacity .... !!!!!!!!!!!\n \n(it\'s a little violent movie & similar concept of "the matrix" trilogy)'
p12
aS'As a passing observation I would point out that Lucy is a coded name, that \ncan be seen alphanumerically as L=12, U=21, please note that the first two \nletters are a mirror effect to each other, then C=3 and Y=25. After \nreducing all letters into numbers, we get 333-7. Of course 3X7=21 and so if \nwe apply this 3 code to 7, we get 21 three times, 21-21-21,  which then \nreduces to a 3, for each 21, thus producing the second set of 333, that \nwhen added + to the first set of 333, then produces a 666.  Lucy, is clear \n333 mirror code for 666 in your face.  I cant wait to analyze and observe \nthe story line to this movie.  I just know it is going to be full of \ninteresting findings.'
p13
aS'Friday night movies, what to watch, Lucy looks good, Hercules looks good, \nwhat to watch????'
p14
aS'This must be an AMAZING movie!!! Scarlett Johanson is one of my favorite \nactresses!!!!'
p15
aS"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think they mean that we have personal access \n(as in when we choose what the brain does) to 10% and she can CONTROL all \n100% from this drug. If I'm wrong, please tell me, but I can't wait to see \nthis movie"
p16
aS'OMG! Scarlett Johansson (aka Black Widow) comes back with a new EPIC action \nmovie! The movie is called "Lucy" and will be released at the end of the \nmonth (always speaking of Greece). :D Well... As for the plot, just take a \nlook at the trailer! ;) It is STUNNING! Trust me!\n(Nikoletta, what ya think? ;) )\n Lucy Official Trailer #1 (2014) - Scarlett Johansson Movie HD'
p17
aS'we actually use 100% of our brains.'
p18
aS'While this movie does look interesting (it\'s like if someone took the movie \n"limitless" and turned the dial to eleven) my only gripe, and this is a big \none, is that it\'s perpetuating the myth that we only use 10% of our brain. \nSome neurobiologists even go as far as to call this myth (quote, unquote) \n"...so wrong it\'s almost laughable...".\n\nWhile it is true that at any given moment all of the brain\'s regions are \nnot firing concurrently, over the course of a day you use 100% of your \nbrain. \n\nWhat seems to be happening in this film suggests that this "drug" is \nrewriting her brain to be more efficient overall, and strengthen her \ncurrent neural pathways as well as others for the future (please correct me \nif i\'m wrong)'
p19
aS"I watched this movie recently. I can't believe how stupid it was."
p20
aS'When will people get that we already use 100% of our brains at different \ntimes...'
p21
aS"Imagine if you unlock your brain's true capacity... GG son no need to go to \nschool xD"
p22
aS'who says using 100% of our brain gives us superpowers??\nmaybe we become more inteligent and everyone could be space \nengineers,,superpowers is too much'
p23
aS'ILLIMUNATI'
p24
aS'My only favorite scene was the ending time travel/space travel scene.'
p25
aS'ive seen her boobies'
p26
aS"Eh who cares if its a limitless rip off? I'm looking forward to seeing \nScarlett Johansson kick some ass. This is the next movie I am actually \ngoing to watch in theaters."
p27

p28
aS'Co si stanie jeli czowiek zacznie wykorzystywa 100% swojego mzgu?'
p29
aS'great movie im sure.. but i hate this shitty actor scarslut ..'
p30
aS'watched this movie today and it blew my freaking mind'
p31
aS'this movie is kind of similar to limetless'
p32
aS'10% of their brain capacity? lmao, wrong wrong wrong WROOONG'
p33
aS'I have always wondered what humans would be capable of doing if we knew how \nto access 100% of our brains.  I believe we would be psychic, telekinetic, \nand the amount of information we would be able to store, and learn.  You \nknow scientists have been trying to unlock that 90% for decades.'
p34
aS'This movie is just epic,you realy need to watch it! :)'
p35
aS'This looks hella good'
p36
aS'was this movie any good?'
p37
aS'we were complaining about Hollywood that gives us only garbage of movies.\nSo,there you go........\nLearn from it,it s not for entertainment!'
p38
aS'THIS IS GONNA BE THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!'
p39
aS'Kind of reminds me of Limitless.  In the way of, a drug accesses 100% of \nyour brain, defying the 10% of our brain belief.  But, it looks like if \nLimitless took more of a Jason Borne esque way of it.'
p40
aS"100% percent of her brain my ass, if thats true how come she didn't realize \nthat thats not the kitchen XD"
p41
aS"Movie time, 1st up LUCY It's better than I thought It would be so far.\nGot my #orvilleredenbachers #popcorn #budweiser up next \n#walkamongthetombstones and #theequalizermovie have a good afternoon.\n#movies  "
p42
aS"It's based on 'ten percent of brain myth', which is literally a myth.\n\nActually, our brain is always in active status. Think about that we can \nhear, see and feel always, and our body temperature is maintained properly \nand digestion process of intestine works even if we are sleeping. These are \nall controlled by our brain, the neurological process.\n\nCheck the ''ten percent of brain myth' part of wikipedia or find brain \nactivity scan image when we read, hear, talk and think words, it can never \nbe just 10 percent usage.

p46
aS'yeah science bitches !! '
p47
aS'Damn, she looks hot.'
p48
aS'You CAN unlock Full brain capacity!!!!! by focusing, hard working, \nmeditating, praying before DAWN (the most important part)! Then you will be \nwitness of wonders!'
p49
aS"These is untrue.There a reason why most human beings cant access more than \n10% percent of it's brains capacity.The reason is that no matter how some \npeople try to access more than 10%,other humans aspect would not permit the \nindividual's brain on doing so.Take as an example a plastic bottle,try \npouring liquids that are more than 50 degrees Celsius,let see if doesn't \nburn the bottle.There is a reason why God limit every capacity or potential \nof every human being.Were just too greedy and uncontented."

aS'I saw this movie when it came out, its not perfect, but the concept is \nreally thought provoking, what does happen to a human when they use 100% of \ntheir brain, the result is very interesting, I kept thinking about it for \ndays afterwards.'
p54
aS'This movie is so annoying!'
