S'Using my amazing psychic powers, I predict that this will be just as awful \nas the others'
p1
aS'ALL THESE TRANSFORMERS FILM SHOULD BE ABOUT OPTIMUS PRIME not about Human \nCharacters. Optimus is the reason why everyone watches these films HE IS \nTRANSFORMERS'
p2
aS'Optimus prime kills lockdown in the end by ripping his head in half. I know \nbecause i have seen the film and i hope i pissed you off.'
p3
aS'Why are there freaking dinosaurs in transformers. '
p4
aS'Isn\'t Optimus supposed to say "We are giving you freedom!" in 2:13?\n\nAnyways, I like that. "Aaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh!" just sounds stupid.'
p5
aS"Good trailer but it doesn't convey the plot of the movie, wtf is it about?"
p6
aS"This film is all that's wrong with cinema nowadays."
p7
aS'Finally after three freaking movies, we finally get a transformers movie \nthat might actually be accurate to the source material.'
p8
aS'This movie was so crap. This is one of the very few movies that made me \nfall asleep because it was that boring regardless how much "action" was in \nit.'
p9
aS'man i thought i fucked up for real though, russian roulette took 5k from me \ni play my last 100 and bammmm 25k ! Life is good every since last \nnight.Called some shordys over smoked some loud,bought some new shit. Got \nabout 17k left, you think i should continue playing?'
p10
aS'Haha... I really have to eat my words... this film was AMAZING. It was \nactually about the Transformers themselves, each one of them had character. \nThe story was engaging, the special effects were obviously jaw dropping, \nthe characters were brilliant and cheesy, strong female characters, \nmassively expanded universe with lots of exposition. The origins of the \nTransformers was explained, but left questions that may be revealed in the \nnext installment.\n\nThe Autobots were each given loads of screen time, had plenty to say, \nGalvatron was amazing and sounded just like G1 Megatron, his story was \namazing especially how he was the real one in control. Lockdown was a \nreally great villain - ruthless, brutal, an utterly cold killer who was, \nrefreshingly for a villain, ambivalent towards humans. Poor Ratchet and \nLeadfoot... their fates really made me hate Lockdown.\n\nMichael Bay has outdone himself this time and has really breathed new life \ninto Transformers. This film is completely different in tone to the \nprevious three - Mark Wahlberg had a really good performance, his character \nwas very relate-able and much easier to sympathise with than Sam Witwicky \nwho I found obnoxious.\n\nOf course it was cheesy, but it\'s Transformers so why would you expect \notherwise? My jaw dropped, I got goosebumps, shivers down my spine. I was \nblown away by this film. Funnily enough though I watched the first \nTransformers film from 2007 and I said to myself "this is stupid, it barely \nshows the Transformers! If only it showed them more, it would be amazing." \nWhat do you know, this film truly delivered as a PROPER TRANSFORMERS FILM \nand I was not disappointed.'
p11
aS'Humans are so dumb why are they betraying the autobots if they were the one \nwhos saving new york '
p12
aS'Transformers: Age of Shameless Advertising.\n\nSeriously, there is a painfully stupid amount of product placement in this \nmovie.'
p13
aS'omg this new transformers movie was like a freakin thriller it has a more \nclear and better storyline, and this time we even get to see optmius prime \nget pissed off for the first time!'
p14
aS'PREDICONS????'
p15
aS'Yay no more Shia Le Buff (funny how he isnt buff at all)..'
p16
aS'how do none of you understand what the motive is in this movie?'
p17
aS'Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014)         June 27th, 2014   '
p18
aS'Not as good as the 3rd but good'
p19
aS"Please, save your money and don't see this movie. The trailer makes this \nmovie looks so awesome! But the movie sucks. ._. But I do have to admit the \nwhat, like 30 minutes of fight scenes were awesome!"
p20
aS"I downloaded it, couldn't get through it all. This movie is painfully \nbad.... like REALLY frikken bad. And the dialog in the movie is ... I know \nyou have heard this before? Written by a 6 year old? Well.... I don't think \nthat metaphor has ever applied more. 2 hours waste of time. \n\nDO NOT DOWNLOAD - DO NOT BUY - DO NOT WATCH this piece of shit garbage."
p21
aS"I thought it would be better. They basically rode the dinobots to the fight \nthat's it. Now optimus is flying threw space without a ship lol this movie \nsucked"
p22
aS'The movie is good but I am deeply disappointed they did not exploit the \ndinobauts concept more. No character development at all.'
p23
aS'Giant robotic dinosaurs and dragons? Now I like Transformers. '
p24
aS'I found this movie too cheesy and outcome of Galvatron was just like the \nprevious Transformers of saying "Till next time Prime" heard it all before, \nsame shit nothing new although I prefer Mark Warlberg over that annoying \nShia. Im a die hard fan but they didnt give the Dynobots any justice. It \nleaves the audience asking questions but it didnt live up to its hype. 6/10'
p25
aS"Am i the only one that found this movie...awfully long.....with a whatever \nscenario and reallyyyy stupid dialogues?\ni expected better....\nBy the way in the scene where  Cade shot  Lockedown  and he is returning \nfire at this split second where Cade ducks for cover u see Cade's stunt man \nright next to him.....!! lol...i mean u give thousand of dollars making a \nmovie and u dont bother take ur time checking what u actually publish?"
p26
aS'where is sam in this one'
p27
aS'Among all the Transformers 1,2,3.. this one is the best Transformers i have \never watched.. it played very close to the source the source material... \n the idea of "Transformium" was the best thing that happened in the movie.. \nand when Lockdown said "You were not born, you were created".. Hell thats a \nbig hint and tribute to the source material! It suggested the \nQuientessons,Unicron and Primus! Unlike T2 where the Transformers were born \nfrom Hatchlings, was a friggin stupid insult to the franchise...\n\nFor all you people who cant understand what is going in the story, man you \nguys are sure first time ignorant Transformer fans that need to read some \nTransformers lore especially Unicron... this movie had great shots of \nOptimus Prime..  they really gave him a role on his own instead of sucking \nup to Sam Witwicky...this was the only movie out of the 3 that gave Optimus \nPrime something to do instead of focusing all the roles on 1 stupid \nobnoxious kid..\n\nMichael Bay actually did a good job on this movie.. he actually got all his \nCamera angles right.. there was shots and good time for the Transformers \nfight.. the people who said Transformers 1 was better, dont gimme me that \nshit.. you could barely see anything happening with all the bad mixed up \nshoots with humans blocking the fights which lasted a few seconds... this \nmovie showed the Transformers actually fighting than showing Sam and his gf \nrunning through all the crap in the movie..'
p28
aS"If see one more movie about wanton urban destruction I'm gonna hurl. It \nboggles credibility how many civilians must die in these \nsuperhero/monster/robot battles. And crumbling buildings is getting SO \nold..."
p29
aS'the people watch this movies? or only the kids?'
p30
aS'This ending of trailer seem to be really bad. Killing dinobots at the end. \n-_-'
p31
aS'this looks so stupid i mean yeahhh lets kill the transformers because we \ndont need them its not like we cant use them to make world peace with them, \nor maybe if other deceptecon  or maybe it starts world war 3 buuuuuut no ! \nwe dont need them lets just kill them all'
p32
aS'Truly a master peice. Micheal Bay is the artist of our generation. \nHitchcock and Kubrick were toddlers playing with cameras compared to that \nmans genius '
p33
aS'where is Shia Le Buff?'
p34
aS'its just me or movies nowadays suck so bad '
p35
aS'Everything about this movie screams reduced budget.'
p36
aS"To be honest, this is just another action movie. The only thing I liked \nabout it, was Bumblebee and the music... But, that's it, really. >.<"

aS'what does optimus say when hes in his "G1" vehicle mode?'
p41
aS"it's a dragonbot not a dinobot lol"
p42
aS"It's Transformers, there's no top-notch story for you and you shouldn't \nexpect to see that. The animation and the films are all about explosions \nand Michael Bay's perfect for that."
p43
aS"1:30 That's what we should tell Bay about these series of movies. They \nshould just go extinct."
p44
aS"Explosions..... Explosions.... Explosions.......... That's just Michael \nBay!"

p51
aS'its just me or movies nowadays suck so bad '
p52
aS'#MovieReview Transformers: Age of Extinction -  When scrappy-struggling \nMark Walburg finds a broken transformer and decides to repair it - the \ntomfoolery begins. The "powers-that-be" want it, but Marky Mark refuses to \nbetray his new extraterrestrial buddy  no matter what utter destruction it \nbrings into his life and those around him. At this point it barely matters \nabout the plot, all that matters is - it\'s fun and it\'s about giant robots \nfighting each other and Uncle Sam.'
p53
aS'To many actor changes :\\ and im not keen on the acting, and now this kinda \nseems like a stupid money drain option'
p54
aS" #movies   #watched  Transformers: Age of Extinction\n\nWell. It's just too much. Too much action. Too much time. Too much barely \ndeveloped characters. Even Mark Wahlberg can't bring life to it. The whole \nthing is hard to follow and it's rather boring than entertaining.\n\nMy rating is 5/10."
p55
aS'Mass destruction and overused special effects alone do not make a good \nmovie. Just like the countless other movie sequels that have come out over \nrecent years, this one is the same junk with increasingly worse storyline \n(or lack there of). I enjoyed Transformers 3 until they started repeating \nthe same thing over and over again: an Autobot rams through the city \nsmashing worthless Decepticons, with occasional failure. It quickly lost \nthe realistic emotion I would associate with apocalyptic human genocide. \nWhen humans are being zapped, the audience needs to tear up, not laugh.'
p56
aS'Within the countless explosions, sexual objectification, product placement, \nand racial stereotypes I sensed the presence of Michael Bay.'
p57
aS'Trailer is better than the movie ... ://'
p58
aS'The WORST movie of 2014. The director destroyed the franchise + the actors \nare playing really low. Only the special effects are ok.'

p61
aS'can anybody tell me how that silent called at 1:45 ?'
p62
aS'I enjoyed it'
p63
aS'could they make a tranformers movie without humans lol ? like Prime going \nafter the creator and fighting stuff '
p64
aS'mark walhberg is a terrible actor'
p65
aS"Cristopher Nolan's movie is more better than Michael Bay's "
p66
aS'The voice of the Optimus Prime is just AMAIZING'
p67
aS'This is a continuation of the previous ones, right? and not a full on \nre-boot?'
p68
aS'DAAAAAAD!'
p69
aS'ALL HAIL GALVATRON !!!!'
p70
aS'The dialogs seem cheezy and some points and the way humans always find a \nconvinient way to keep going makes the plot look kinda stupid,but the fight \nscenes are awsome and it has lots of fight scenes,its good to spent a \nsaturday night watching it on dvd but nothing more than that.Oh,i have a \nquestion,are we going to see Optimus fight the Creators on the next \nmovie?cuz that would be stupid.'
p71
aS'so Optimus Prime got all shot up, and the shells are inside him...\nhollywood logic.'

p77
aS'One common thing about all the Transformers movie is that they always have \na male porn star and a slut. '
p78
aS"Trailer is much better than movie lol i have waited to watch but now i'm \ndisappointed, i loved the other parts but this .. the story, characters, \nspecial effects haha this is joke!"
p79
aS'wow what a shitty movie'
p80
aS'awesome movie'
p81
aS"Oh god just watched this 2hrs 30mins of my life I'll never get back. I love \nthe Transformers movies as dumb fun but this is by far the worst of the \nfranchise, even with the dino-bots (great idea) included it was still awful \n!! And it looks like they are setting up for another 4 movies with the \nresurrection of megatron."
p82
aS'What I truly desagree is to show Grimlock like a Carnotaurus, HE IS \nTYRANNOSURUS FOR GOD SAKE. WTF ARE THOSE HORNS?'
p83
aS'Transformer is the shit'
p84
aS'I dont understand why people is saying it has bad action, it is one of the \nbest action ever and I think the movie was great. people dont know good \naction if they say it has bad'
