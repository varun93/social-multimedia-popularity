S'Love this movie, but the book is soooooo different. I\'m not saying that\'s \nbad, but I think that maybe the producers decided to take the general \nconcept of the story and make it their own. Also in the book you can really \nunderstand everything she is thinking and dealing with and her confusion \nand the pressure that she puts on herself. I do really love the film though \nand I probably love it as much as the book because it\'s not a film I hate \njust because I read the book and it\'s "so much better" because I can\'t \nreally compare them as they\'re so different.'
