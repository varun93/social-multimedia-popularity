S"I think the theme of irony gets overlooked here..the entire movie has you \ndisgusted with white people.. Then you meet Samuel Jacksons character, and \nthe other black woman in the house, who were given similar powers as white \npeople at that time.. And what did they do with that ? They were just as \nevil and cold blooded, they didn't flinch when the dogs were eating the \nblack fighter slave. I'm pretty sure this was done on purpose to show \nblacks are or can be just as bad with power... White people are not \nevil...the human race itself may be. The black people who weren't enslaved \nwere the same. "
p1
aS" White people are truly evil and I have no clue why. I honestly believe \nthey are born that way. Like most Chinese are smart, most African Americans \nare athletic, or uniquely talented, most Arabic are highly determined to do \nwhatever, most Hispanics are very hardworking. WHITE PEOPLE can be the \nabove HOWEVER it's only to belittle the next person. They want to be smart \nenough to enslave other races legally, talented enough to profit while \nbeing racist, and work insanely hard to keep other races beneath them even \nthough out of all races they are the most evil, weird, disgusting , lawless \ncreatures to exist. FUCK WHITE PEOPLE."
p2
aS"um ok, this is cliche but it needs to be said again...not all white people \nare racist. we've have developed good minds since the de-segregation in \nAmerica and these stuff should be left in the past. bashing people who are \nwhite now makes you a racist full stop"
p3
aS"I wonder if the people who refer to this movie as anti-white \npropaganda actually watched it. Django was rescued, freed, paid, and \nmentored by a German white guy. Never mind the fact that the same white guy \nrisked his life to rescue Django's wife out of the kindness of his heart. \nThe white man who took Django under his wing is easily the most \nsympathetic and morally sound main character of the film, despite being a \ndeadly bounty hunter, and Django spends at least three-quarters of the \nmovie as his sidekick.\n\nIf they really wanted to send an anti-white message then they could have \ngone a lot farther. They didn't even go far enough to depict an independent \nblack man who doesn't need to be supported, trained, fed, funded, and \nreunited with his long-lost love by a generous and compassionate German man \nwith a death wish."
p4
aS'white people sucks.'
p5
aS'To say I hate white honkies would be an understatement. \nAll u mothafuckas going to hell, babies and all.'
p6
aS'I remember watching this movie and how much i hated Stephen the racist \nservant and later on i found out he was Samuel Jackson, mind blown, S.L.J \ncan play any role at his best. Really Great Movie.'
p7
aS"fucking white trash, i'm so happy that they are getting less and less while \nthe asian and black population are growing, we gonna kill this fucking \nwhite race, by the way i'm not racist I just wanted to show how we feel, \nwhen we are getting racist comments every fucking day"
p8
aS'I love at the end how they try and make Dicaprio look bad, like being a \nslave owner was a bad thing. It was what was done back then and was a \nnecessary thing to do and a good thing. The worst thing that ever happened \nto America was letting niggers go free as they have destroyed every \nneighborhood they touch!'
p9
aS'I am damn proud of being white, no apologies at all. But I got to tell you, \nI have never been more angry at more white folks in one movie in my life! \nNow, the movie was stretched ALOT with the racism. But it is a Tarantino \nmovie, you got to expect the unexpected. Django is freaking awesome! Wanna \nHold my Hand?'
p10
aS'How could any white person watch this with any dignity? \nWhen you look at it from a 3rd person perspective...\nan Anti white movie being released in a white nation and being payed to see \nby white people.\nInsanity? stupidity? self loathing? what words can describe this!\nIt would be as if they released a movie in Japan that portrayed the \nJapanese as the evil villains and the hero as a Chinese man who gets to \nkill all the Japs. would a movie like that even last 2 seconds in Japan?\n\nor what about Israel, can you imagine a movie being produced in Israel \nwhere a Palestinian gets to "kill jews and get payed for it? what\'s not to \nlike?"'
p11
aS'This movie was pretty good'
p12
aS'Lol this movie sucked...'
p13
aS"I wonder why this movies doesn't show the white slaves.... Oh that's right \nbecause it's Hollywood propaganda to cause racial division, divide & \nconquer"
p14
aS'Fuck a Cracker\nEvery fucking one of you...old young, short tall, cripple or crazy.....\nGO TO HELLLLLLL'
p15
aS'+Shashwat Srivastava , bhai do u recognize the music appears at the end of \ntrailer !!'
p16
aS"More hollywood bullshit to keep hatred, racial division, and the idea of \nwhite racists alive. I bet you anything no white people were watching this \nat any theater in a city. Unless of course you cried during the whole thing \njust so maybe the blacks thought you weren't racist and decide not to beat \nthe shit out of you."
p17
aS'Great movie. Just finished watching it. :)'
p18
aS'"You silver tongue devil, you.."\nThe German was by far my favorite character. Leo D still looks pretty fine, \nconsidering he is getting a little older. My first crush ever ;)'
p19
aS'Why are the white actors only getting the praise in this film? Kerry \nWashington and Samuel L. Jackson were brilliant. White people are so \nannoying at times.'
p20
aS'this movie is fucking awesome haha\nD motha fuking jango son'
p21
aS'This is by far my favourite Quentin Tarantino movie!\n\nEverything about this movie is perfect!\n\n- Acting\n- Music\n- Story\n- Comedy\n- Action\n\n10/10'
p22
aS"Excellent anti white propaganda from the owners of hollywood. Have they \never made a film with a racist black or racist jew in it? I'd pay money to \nsee it."
p23
aS"I can understand why Black Americans flinch at the words and violence in \nthis film, but I still think it's a great film.  The bottom line is that \nAmerican Whites will never know what it's like to be profiled, etc.,for no \nreason.  But, also, Blacks don't know what it's like to be constantly \nharassed in sketchy neighborhoods by Blacks then being forced to pretend \nlike it doesn't happen.  (Don't call me a whiner, cause I've never seen a \nBlack thug fight without either greater numbers or weapons.)"
p24
aS"It's a movie, it's not racist. Characters can be racist, just as they can \nbe murderer's, pyschopath's, rapists, sexist, etc. but they're characters, \nit's not real, it's just a story on a screen that's what films are, I don't \nsee why people can see fiction as racist."
p25
aS"Not many movies I take time to talk about the music but this was one of the \nbest fitting and sometimes unusually fitting soundtracks I've ever heard, \nbut what else do you expect from a Tarantino film?"
p26
aS'Name of song at 00:15?'

p31
aS"only movie where the black guy doesn't die"
p32
aS'I would rate this movie 10/10 as it contains humour, wit and full on action \nnot to mention a nice soundtrack. The beginning and end are fantastic! \nDefinitely recommend this film to almost anyone (except maybe a black \nperson...). Comment on this comment on how good you guys found this film - \n?/10  '
p33
aS'"fuck the white people for making us slaves" Lmao. Yes it was wrong but did \nwe invade Africa and start a war to take Africans as slaves? NO! You can \nthank the Muslims for selling Africans to the Whites instead of bitching at \nwhites. Every race is fucked up in the end. Every comment i see is how \nWhites molest and kidnap but Africans Chop babies up and slaughter whole \ntribes, Muslims kill because someone doesn\'t believe in the prophet \nMohammad, Chinese throw kill because they had a daughter and not a son blah \nblah blah, i could go one with every race. Every race has a problem so stop \nbeing a little bitch and get over it. The only thing people should care \nabout is receiving and giving respect to one another. '
p34
aS'White chicks is better'
p35
aS'Ohhh here we go again racist crackers and niggers fighting at the comment \nsection again '
p36
aS"Can movies not take place when there were fucking slaves anymore, what with \nhow sensitive everyone is now?\n\nThere were SLAVES! That means there was RACISM! Get the fuck over it! It \nhappened long before your birth! Stop bitching about it!\n\nAnd the whites saying that this is anti-white propaganda, fuck you! If a \nQ.T. movie affected you so much, you need to pull your head out of your ass \nand toughen up, cause there's much worse out there! "

p57
aS"I'm still wondering why Christoph Waltz was nominated in the supporting \nactor categorie. I mean he WAS the movie. Yeah, Jamie Foxx was also great \nbut I'm thinking that Waltz had the leading role."

aS'I cannot say I enjoyed this film. It had a godless quality to it.  I am not \none who respects violence automatically. It left me feeling disturbed \nbecause I thought it would encourage black people to seek vengeance, since \nthe vengeance angle is presented as a positive thing.

aS'Good movie but extremely racist and unrealistic in some points. The "nigger \non a horse" scene was retarded considering about 25% of the Wild West \ncowboys were African-American. Plenty of them were Outlaws too which you \ncan look up on google. But a good movie overall i\'d say.'
