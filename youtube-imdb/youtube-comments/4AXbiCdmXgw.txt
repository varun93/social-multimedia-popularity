S'Film night tonight starts with this.'
p1
aS"though I hate the action sequences and how I hate how they portrayed the \ntrained soldiers as dumb to use the force, I liked the ending and how brave \nthe girl is. I can rate it 5/10. I did wish the action scenes were so much \nbetter and they did not made the police dumb. I seemed to watch Air Force \nOne  again but the difference is, it's not the plane but the president's \nresident already. Air Force One is better but I still like it. Also, I do \nwish I've seen a braver president the way Harrison Ford is in Air Force \nOne!"
p2
aS'obama is black'
p3
aS'Looks like some good ole predictive programming'

aS'The trailer made me forget the movie was bad.. I wish the movie was this \nepic.'
p14
aS'this movie is a leftist pornography,  but the action is nice.'
p15
aS'If you like the Die Hard movies you may like this. If you want realistic \nyou may want to avoid this. I found myself laughing at times and upset at \nothers. "Get your hands off my Jordan\'s."'
p16
aS"Dumbed Down movie based on same tired formula and implausible scenes . A. \nDC would have been evacuated , they wouldn't let a crowd that close to WH . \nSecret Service lady cussed out a Commanding General and he didn't say a \nword , give me a break and of course the lone Hero part was so predicable , \nit's why I rather watch Korean movies . What else , oh the propaganda \nbesides the Scaring , the Hindu god of death was in scene w/ the formula \ngeeky computer guy and the brought down the black pres . w/ stereotyping \nhim in Nike Shoes and oh all the joking around during the battle is an \nobvious indicator it's just another Masonic formula Movie for dumbed down \nmasses"

p54
aS'Lol this was like Olympus Has Fallen. Except that was better than this.'
p55
aS"so the girl saved the white house by waving a flag i'm sure the pilots \nwould have common sense even if they did have a president order to \nairstrike the white house with civillans running out after what happened \nto  911 i dont think they would go ahead with the airstrike"
p56
aS'I thought that is Olympus Has Fallen...'
p57
aS"This movie had lots of action and didn't fail on the comedy. Though this \ntrailer is too damn dramatic. The movie was not like this. "

p69
aS'I think Hollywood learned its lesson from this failure of a movie to stop \nwith the black presidents for a while.   People want to escape when they go \nto the movies, not be reminded of real life. '
p70
aS'Hell of a way to get a job! Channing Tatum planned the whole thing so he \ncould get the job. Anyway who leaves their own kid in danger and goes to \nsave the president of america. I think someone needs parenting lessons!!!'

p82
aS"This is an awesome movie, not only action but there's a comedic part to it \ntoo. However, I think the budget for this movie was really costly. All in \nall, it's definitely above average ! "
