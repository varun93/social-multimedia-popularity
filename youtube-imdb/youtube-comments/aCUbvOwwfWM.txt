aS'yet another movie that you will all watch and praise and say "OMG this is \nso true we need to do something" while you sit in the cinema sipping on a \ngallon of coke while scoffing down popcorn and chocolates. fucking \npeople... You can\'t put the blame on companies, they do what they need to \ndo to be successful and they do it with in the laws that are set, they \ndon\'t force you to drink coke, they never told you that smiths chips or \nlays potato crisps what ever you call them were better for you than actual \nvegetables. you idiots bought that crap and now you\'re suffering from it, \nfucking deal with it, stop finding excuses and reason to why you don\'t want \nit to be your fault and just fix your fucking problems.\n\nI would love to see a movie that instead of pointing the blame on the big \nguy talk about the little guy, call out every fucking ad campaign and viral \nmarketing scheme and stupid fucking movie that blames the big companies for \nevery ones problems. Lets talk about todays society of bitchy know it all \nfuck heads that are to lazy to fix their problems so they have to sue and \nblame everyone else with their bottomless storage file of knowledge that \nthey read of the internet because god forbid they do anything wrong, noooo \nthey are the consumer and we all know the consumer knows best, the consumer \nknows enough to shovel its mouth full of processed shit and junk food to \nthe point where they develop heart problems and become obese, yep the \nconsumer is a fucking genius.\n\nI eat junk food and a healthy mix of good natural food, I exercise everyday \nand I don\'t have any fucking problems. I\'m living proof (Big emphasis on \nthe word LIVING)  that you can drink coke, you can snack on shit and still \nlive a healthy life. you know how? Because I fucking try and I don\'t blame \neveryone else for my problems because they are my problems not theirs. \nFucking get some sense cunts.'

I, for example, eat quite a lot of sugar, chocolate etc, and yet I \nhave my doctors telling me I'm unhealthily underweight... \nThe solution is simple. Stop eating so much. That's the root problem. I \nlook at the amounts of food that these people eat in one meal, and I \ncouldn't eat that much even if I forced myself. \nIt's these fake additives that do it - people are too lazy to cook their \nown food, so they buy this premade stuff - which of course is gonna be \nfilled with additives and sugar fat and salt on top of that.\n\nIs it the companies' fault for selling the things that consumers want to \nbuy??

Guess what, it's the same \nthing in most other countries!\nTruth is that people are lazy and so when shopping they choose the easiest \nfoods to eat (ie. ready meals, microwavable meals, canned vegetables and \nmeat etc.). These foods are full of sugar. THAT'S WHY YOU ARE FAT. If \npeople took more care about choosing their food and not take their car to \ngo to the shop which is only 1/2 mile away away, then you wouldn't be so \nfat.\nObviously, some people suffer from medical conditions which cause them to \nbe overweight, but if even only 50% of the overweight people in the USA \nhave this medical condition... then well, USA, it means that you have \nterrible health conditions and a terrible healthcare."

How about if a law is passed to require everyone in the country to \nattend a government run exercise program for an hour 3 or 4 days per week \nwhere attendance is monitored and reported with heavy fines levied for \nfailing to attend? We have way too many nannycrats telling people what they \ncan and cannot do already. Worry about yourselves and leave everyone else \nto do the same.

aS"I get that sugar is bad and that the average american diet is messed-up but \nI believe that freedom of choice and will power are important values and \nshould be used to combat this not the government.

I have been trained in nutrition by USA \nhockey so I know I have an advantage and this really doesn't apply to me as \nmuch, but the flip side of this story is that if you are not on a diet of \ntoo much sugar and salt you can't handle it cause your tolerance is very \nlow.
