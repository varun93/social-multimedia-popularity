S'Actually... this trailer is quite excellent beacause it made me want to see \nthis movie by creating curiosity... then... I saw the movie >-('
p1
aS"Here's the secret this movie sucked ass."
p2
aS'The Spirit (2008) - Official Trailer #1'
p3
aS'Killer movie.'
p4
aS"One of the most disappointing movies I've seen."
p5
aS'Whoreswhoreswhoreswhoreswhorswhoreswhoreswhoreswhores'
p6
aS"agreed. It's just a shame didn't have anywhere near the same amount of \n/energy/ as the trailer - the song gives it a balance which the film sadly \nlacks. Spirit could have been one of the best films from last/this year but \nalas was not to be.."
p7
aS"This just doesn't work. Sorry, but Will Eisner and Frank Miller are too far \napart."
p8
aS'The best thing of the movie is this song. The rest is suck.'
p9
aS"@Zygotguy The band's name is just Hybrid, sorry."
p10
aS'@255Knights Hybrid - Choke'
p11
aS"I personally don't think this is a very good trailer, but thats just me."
p12
aS'I wanna see it!'

p14
aS"I can agree with that alot of heroes set in the time period of 3o's-40's \nfought Nazis fopr that reason. Look at Indiana Jones, he fought Nazi's in \nthree out of four films. They're about as bad as you get when choosing bad \nguys for a superhero to fight."
p15
aS'AAH SCARLETT'
p16
aS'agreed'
p17
aS"@YOSEPH619 no you're not. It's not the best movie but it's STILL better \nthan The Twilight Saga."

p46
aS"At AFL489, What happened is that they combined only the best sequences in \nfilm with a killer song to lure people into theaters...pity it couldn't \nlive up to its trailer."
p47
aS"I have not yet seen this movie, but it's hard if I want to. Based on the \ntrailer I'd say: AWESOME! based on the actors, also. But based on the \ncomments on youtube: I'd say I'm gonna hate it."

p89
aS'The song is called Choke by Hybrid.'
p90
aS"The trailer (and song) is awesome, the movie is ok. But I don't think it \nsucks, like most people seem to think. The women in this movie are mostly \nhot, no doubt, the parts with Samuel Jackson are too silly to be neither \ncool nor that funny, but the parts with G Macht speaking as the narrator in \nthe background are really good. They're the ones that feel most Frank \nMiller-style, and that's how the entire movie should've been like. Still, \nit doesn't suck."

aS'lol that is really gross'
p92
aS'@Samson1091 Best movie ever. It was hilarious. And the effects...'
