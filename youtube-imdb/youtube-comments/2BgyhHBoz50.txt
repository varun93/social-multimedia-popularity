S'Love Indiana Jones '
p1
aS'may 22 my birthday :D'
p2
aS"I've seen this movie so many times and I still dont know why everybody \nhates it, I love this one, the 2 best of Indy, sincerely I think that \nsaying Shia LaBeouf or the fridge scene, dont you think that Willie Scott \nwas more annoying screaming all time, and it was more stupid jumping from a \nplane on a boat with three people, crashing with trees and falling again \nand nothing happened? And that Dr. schneider was a bigger dissapointment \nthan Mutt Williams, and that Irine Spalko did more interesting things or \nwas a better villain, the other were just ordinary people laughing, sitting \nand giving orders, Mola Ram was pretty cool, so I don't find nothing bad \nwith Kingdom of Crystal Skull"
p3
aS"A big deception, but i hope there's will be a 5 !"
p4
aS"It's coming back to me....My 9 year old self was excited to say the least."
p5
aS"I don't know what's wrong with you guys! I thought Indiana Jones 4 was \npretty cool! OK, OK, it's too much CGI, I know, but if it went back to stop \nmotion it would have been too cheesy. The first three films are classics, \nof course, and I love all of them, but Indi 4 was quite ok. CHILL OUT, GUYS \n!!"
p6
aS"Crystal Skull was a SWEET movie. It matches the vibe of the original 3, and \nit has the good fortune to have the historical Enemy of THE COLD WAR \nRUSKIES. And the 50's Greaser theme was awesome. People really should give \nit the credit it deserves and stop being Hipster Fan-Boy bitches about it.\nTo illustrate why the fridge scene and aliens from 4 are not anywhere \nnear as bad as fanboys make out? Ive compiled a list of  OTHER retarded \nthings from the FIRST 3 Indiana Jones movies, just to remind those guys \nthat these are ADVENTURE FILMS:\n-Jumps from a plane on a rubber raft onto a mountain range with two others, \nand all survive without a scratch.\n-Boards a sealed submarine in the ocean by somehow opening an internally \nlocked hatch, enters and hides in close quarters, all while fully clothed \nand soaking wet and leaving a water trail everywhere, and is not detected.\n-The entire mining cart chase in Temple of Doom.\n-Breaks off a flag pole for use as a Jousting Stick merely by riding past \nit and grabbing it.\n-The absurd speedboat fight scene ender in Crusade, featuring an \nabove-water-line ships propeller running in reverse while the ship is \nclearly docked and stationary.\n-Walks through underground catacombs in Venice filled waist deep with \nflammable liquid, using a naked flame torch as a light source, which \nfrequently and visibly drops flaming embers into said liquid.\n- A cup filled with water that kills people with accelerated age merely \nbecause its the wrong one.\n-An Ark that turns people into sand because they were looking.\n-A Thaggi Magi who can remove peoples organs with his bare hands, \nregardless of rib-cage and leaving no wound.\n-Seagulls crashing a WW2 fighter plane.\n-The entire Circus Train chase in Crusade.\n-The word of God trial, which shows a shot of the letters from \nunderneath, showing that they are supported by NOTHING.\nThese are just adventure films pitched at kids and teenagers you critical \nold farts.\nIndy 4 was FINE. If you hate it? It is YOU who got old and lame, not the \nfranchise.............. and for the record? I'm 40 years old."

aS'Indiana Jones IV = 78%/3.4 User Score RottenTomatoes, 65 Metacritic, \nMovieWeb 82% and 3.8 User Score, Cinemascore B+, Yahoo! Movies 4/5 or "B", \nMovieFone 3.5 Score and 4.0 Critical, Fandango Users - Go Now!, was the \nmost watched film on television for 2009/2010, a DVD hit and the highest \ngrossing worldwide film of 2008, and I\'ve got tons more info. It was a very \nwell received film by the critics and filmgoing public so quit worrying \nabout internet minorities who hate it.\n\nOverall - quit whining that "people hate" this film. On a few internet \nforum-dwelling circles, sure. But those same people hate \'Temple of Doom\', \ntoo.'
p11
aS"it's not as bad as people make it out to be. while raiders and crusade are \nboth solid 10/10s and temple is like 8 or 9/10, i'd say crystal skull is a \n5/10. it's not a bad movie, it just doesn't hold up to the standards of an \nindiana jones movie."
p12
aS"When I went to see this movie I was soo excited. One, because it was \nanother Indiana Jones movie, and I really like Indiana Jones and the second \nreason is because I'm Peruvian, and the plot was developed there. You could \nimagine my disappointment when I realised that the movie was so \nunbelievably geographically wrong, that I just wanted to fucking peace off \nfrom that movie theatre. I find it really insulting that some people still \nthink that every latinamerican country is fucking Mexico. Not only is Nazca \nnot in Cusco (is in Ica btw, which is south of Lima and is a desert) but \nthe music, clothing, infrastructure and people they used were so off, that \nit makes this movie almost unbearable to watch. \n\nThey spent so much money in this film, and they didn't even bother to at \nleast hire a fucking geography teacher, or search in fucking wikipedia? \nSeriously!"

aS'Hey was also han solo'
p14
aS'should get rid of Harrison and get someone young.'
p15
aS'Yh the temple of doom was just one big set'
p16
aS'Ahh, I was in fourth grade then. I remember it being a "Franks for Fathers" \nday where you bring your dad and you just hang out outside and eat grilled \nfood and chips. It was really nice out. We had a great time and then I went \nto see this movie with my family after school. What great times, I miss \nthem so much.'
p17
aS'1:09-1:22 best scene'
p18
aS'You must be 12. No. 10.'
p19
aS"I couldn't agree more with you good sir. Screw the haters."
p20
aS"okay instresting mate the film just didn't work for me but i do love the \nindiana jones movies there is going to be another one and harrison ford is \ngoing to be in expandables 3"
p21
aS'When I was a kid and young adult I hated Temple of Doom, then when the Indy \nfilms came to DVD in 2003, I grew to appreciate it - flaws and all. Same \nthing happened with Crystal Skull for me. After feeling a bit letdown by it \nin the theater May of 2008, I saw it a few more times on TV and grew to \nenjoy it as well over the years. I feel both it and ToD are unfairly \nmaligned. '
p22
aS'One of the most underrated movies of all time. People may call it silly and \nstupid, but do killer ghosts who melt and blow up people faces not count as \nsilly or stupid? Does saying khali ma and pulling a guys heart out of his \nchest, with the heartless guy still breathing not count as silly or stupid? \nOr how about a man waiting in a temple for 800 years? Indiana Jones is \nsupposed to be silly and over the top, people are just too critical these \ndays. Stars Prequels suck, not Indy 4'

aS'Fans had been begging for another since 1989...can you blame them for \nfinally making one?'
p26
aS'jeez harrison fords still alive ?'
p27
aS'cate blanchet got to be one of the worst female villian ive ever seen in \nthis film'
p28
aS"Really, I don't see why so many people hate this movie so much. I thought \nit was good."
p29
aS'Happy 5th Anniversary to Indy 4! Still my 2nd favorite Indy film, kickass \npulp magic!'
p30
aS"For me the biggest problem, that ruins this film is Shia Labeuf, I just \ncan't stand him... And he always plays the same character in all of his \nfilms. Otherwise not a bad film at all, pretty good actually."
p31
aS'well the 4 wasnt really that bad, ancient civilisations from south america \nbelived that the gods came from the heavens, and they connect pretty well \nthat, with the roswell accident, and the russians during the cold war wr \nlooking alien life and tech. the movie was really well done.'
p32
aS"People don't like Harrison's acting. He's apparently too 'depressing' now."
p33
aS'  '
p34
aS"What's so wrong about this movie???"
p35
aS"Can someone answer this for me?...indiana jones's son is from marion, but \nthis movie takes place in the 1957..so was his son conceived in Raider's of \nthe lost ark (when they were on the ship and had sex?) The math doesn't \nreally add up..?"
p36
aS'1) Crystal Skull 2) Last Crusade 3) Lost Ark 4) Temple Of Doom'
p37
aS'Part time.'
p38
aS'I hate all the criticism because of the aliens. HOW ELSE ARE YOU SUPPOSED \nTO EXPLAIN THE SKULS! Besides, every Indiana Jones movie had a cheesy \nmoment here and there'
p39
aS"Shia LeDouche was the problem with this movie... Swinging through the trees \nwith Monkey's to catch up to cars? Ugh... dont get me wrong, I didn't hate \nthe movie, but I was let down. "
p40
aS'Pretty much. LaBeouf is one of my least favorite actors.'
p41
aS'Hey guys, just got back from the AMC 4-Film Indy Marathon. Everyone there \nstayed for this film and cheered, laughed at the funny parts and clapped at \nthe end and had an awesome time. Other people I know at different marathons \nhad the same situation. Suck on that haters. How does it feel to be in a \nminority? ;)'
p42
aS'To watch them in order... 1. Lost ark 2. Temple of doom 3. Last crusade \n(really?) 4. Crystal skull 5. Emperors tomb (newest)'
p43
aS"I have seen all four Indiana Jones movies now. Raiders of the Lost Ark is \nthe best and the great adventure film ever. Temple of Doom was not good as \nthe other films, but a good film anyways and the scariest and the most \nexciting Indiana Jones movie. The Last Crusade is really good and the least \nbest Indiana Jones movie. The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is not a \nterrible movie, it's fantastic and much better than Temple of Doom."
p44
aS"Mrbig101109 your a complete jackass.Reboot Indiana jones?What was wrong \nwith the first 3 (not including 4 of how horrible that movie was)and you \nwanna see more movies first spiderman didn't need a reboot it was fine with \n3 same with superman we need original ideas but idiots like you keep \nwanting remakes reboots and sequels"
p45
aS'The movie is not bad, it is too much fun, in fact it is the best Indiana \nJones movie for me.'

aS'internet tv - Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) - \nIMDb'
p51
aS'They need to do one more Indiana Jones movie and bring back Sallah he was \nmy favorite Character from the first and third one. and still add Karen \nAllen '
p52
aS"Happy 5th anniversary to this magnficent film! I don't care what anyone \nsays; I think this film is a masterpiece. That UFO taking off at the end \nis, in my opinion, one of the greatest scenes in the history of cinema. \nLet's hope they make number five one day!"
p53
aS'That guy who\'s always saying "Jonesy" looks like Hitler (who let himself \ngo).'
p54
aS'whats the music at the start of the trailer?'
p55
aS'I remember when i USED to be excited to see this film'
p56
aS"Raiders - 9.5/10 Kingdom - 8.5/10 Crusade - 8.4/10 Temple - 8/10 Great \nseries! =) Who's with me on that?"
p57
aS'temple of doom was creepy because of the devil and this was creep + er \nbecause of the ant part o.0'
p58
aS'Yeah it was a good movie!'
p59
aS'Harrison Jones > WORLD OF WARCRAFT (cataclysm - uldum)'
p60
aS"I haven't seen the first Indiana Jones movies, but i have seen this movie \nand is not terrible. It's really brilliant and one of the best Indiana \nJones movies. Steven Spielberg directed the film very good and he should \nreally do this film after the first films. Actors like Harrison Ford, Shia \nLabeouf and Cate Blanchet are fantastic too. See this film!"
p61
aS'All the Indiana Jones films have some bases in facts. Fact there is a lost \nark of the covenant, there was an cult that worshiped Kali, there is a lost \ngrail of Christ, and there are crystal skulls that have no tool marks of \nany kind on them that are found in south America. There are people who \nbelieve that the skulls came from outer space & that the ancient pyramid \nbuilders of the world were aliens. Not liking this movie because it fits \nthe legends of the crystal skulls is a stupid reason.'
p62
aS'i agree, i enjoyed the movie as well. dont see why people dislikes it :P'
p63
aS"The only downside to buying the Indy Blu Ray boxset is this is in it... I \nwatched it on release in the cinema and hadnt watched it since then until \ntoday when I thought maybe its improved now I know what I'm getting, and \nits an Indy film right up to the CG Aliens (thats when I cringe) oh sorry, \nTrans dimensional beings... All the Indy movies had a running tie in with \nthe occult, old world mysticism and legend, which worked beyond well, so \nwhat do you do? Change the golden formula. Well done "
p64
aS'Pretty good in my opinion'
p65
aS'the movie was good...for those indiana jones fans, you should watch \nit...its as good as temple of doom.'
p66
aS"How can people be so mad at George Lucas for every single thing he does. \n'The Star Wars Prequels' and 'Indiana Jones Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' \nwas awesome and epic movies. The haters of the movies and Lucas have no \nreason to hate him and his movies. They are just looking for stuff to hate \n(Red Letter Media). God i was hoping for George Lucas to create Indiana \nJones 5."
p67
aS'"Get down on your knees, COM\' ON SQUEAL, WEEEEEEE, WEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!"'

p72
aS'"Get down on your knees, COM\' ON SQUEAL, WEEEEEEE, WEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!"'
p73
aS"I love this movie! Reasons: Indy's back, more modern (as in area and \ngraphics), intense, old girlfriend's back, new adventure, I live in Nevada \nwhich the beginning of the movie took place, came out on my birthday, I get \nto see the ark again, most of the film is accurate (most) and I don't hear \nanyone saying anything wrong with the 2nd Indiana Jones movie! It has silly \nscenarios, stupidest lines, and the most obnoxious characters (to be fair \nthough, it WAS my first favorite Indiana Jones movie)!"
p74
aS'nice response, dumbass'
p75
aS'I personally think that 25 people made about 1,000 accounts each just to \nrant about Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull.'
p76
aS'I owe it all to the Nostalgia critic.'
p77
aS'I like how on YouTube if you search Kingdom of the Crystal Skull all you \ncan find is trailers instead of clips from the movie cause no one wanted to'
p78
aS"don't know, kingdom of the crystal skull is the only one I've been able to \nsit through but only because i watched it in theatres i find all of them \nextremely boring lol"
p79
aS'i remember watching this in the theaters good days'
p80
aS"It has it's flaws but it's not as bad as so many people say IMO. But for me \nthe 3rd will always be the best."
p81
aS'The actors were so ultra-fuckly overly lit they might as well have been in \nfront of a black background the whole movie.'
p82
aS'You need to get a life. '
p83
aS"Outside of a few people who also usually hate Temple Of Doom, I don't think \nthere's that many that pretend it doesn't exist. Most of the comments here \nare positive, anyway. You're probably thinking this because some like to \nbash it on the net sometimes, but that happens to alot of movies. Don't \ntake it seriously and don't mistake it for the consensus or majority \nopinion. Cmon, if we go by what alot of internet commenters say, then The \nDark Knight Rises sucks according to 'most people'."
p84
aS"I mean seriously kingdom was okay I kind of like it but the script, \ncharacters, the story, doesn't equal temple. It just isn't as good of a \nmovie"
p85
aS'no, fuck you! i dont understand why people hate this film'
