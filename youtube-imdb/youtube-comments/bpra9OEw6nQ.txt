aS"@bellydancingdream - True, everything always depends. Everything is defined \nby sensitive dependence on changing conditions. So if you want to make a \npoint, I'd be interested to hear the specifics."
p6
aS'Watched this three times on HBO. Never caught the beginning of the film but \nit is so great anyway. Whenever Leonardo and Kate star on a film, it is \nalways EPIC.'
p7
aS'@cheekimafia No This Is A Complete Different Move Then Titanic Because They \nGot To Work Together Again'
p8
aS'both the best actors of their time ! '
p9
aS'After watching this trailer who would ever want to watch this? So \ndepressing!'
p10
aS'Movie is full of true emotions, course played by good actors. Like others \nsaid a roller coaster of life. We shared few months with them.Sorry to say, \nbut Jesus or God would have not helped them. Women was much more stronger \nthan this Men. It was akward to feel her hopes flushed away, he was happy \neven though that he said otherwise. She was willing to give everything. In \nthe end she made a decision which took my ground away. Strongest scene, the \nold man turning his earing off......... '
p11
aS'Hacen linda pareja'
p12
aS'Did this movie make anyone else cry?'
p13
aS'beautiful....'
p14
aS'This film is so powerful and upsetting because it reflects reality. Many \npeople seem to essentially get into conventional traps, be it massive debt \nor having children too early, they work jobs they hate and forget about \nwhat it means to be alive.'
p15
aS'The actress also said that her husband called her before these scenes, \nsaying ( Come, O Kate all mature here ) . How much is funny hhhhhh '
p16
aS'we had to read this book for AP english it was sooo boring and depressing! '
p17

p22
aS"I'm 17 and when I watched Titanic the first time I was three with my \nparents and of course I didn't know what was going on until I was 8. I just \nrecently watched it last week making the count of ten times. Leo and Kate \nshould be in more movies together. Heck they should been together in real \nlife. They look good together in looks and personality. Now I'm done \nranting *sighs heavily*. :)"
p23
aS'Watched the movie, it was depressingly great. Kate and Leo are BOTH amazing \nin it. You can feel their raw emotions in every scene, not to mention great \nchemistry together. Both deserved oscar-winning performances.'
p24
aS'@peacelvr815 did you just ruin the movie for me?'

aS'they filmed some of this near where i live '
p33
aS"I'll never let gooooo... "
p34
aS'This is a great movie with a tragic ending. I wonder if this movie could \nhave been better if it had a happy ending instead.'
p35
aS"British actress said Ken Winslet Titanic star she was concerned by the \nperformance of a group of sex scenes in front of Hollywood star Leonardo \nDiCaprio in One together Avelamanma (Revolutionary Road) The likely cause \nof concern to the presence of her husband, director Sam World Middens in \nall these scenes as the film's director. Ken admitted that her husband deal \nwith it naturally, but also encouraged them to continue what you are doing."
p36
aS'@daphpac the song is "Wild is the Wind" by Nina Simone :)'
p37
aS"so that's what woulda happened if rose and jack had lived!"
p38
aS'awesome movie, just seen it on dvd today :)'
p39
aS"this movie is powerful. of course it's not for some people, as it is not a \n'feel-good' film; it shows the naked truth of the harsh reality for some. \nthe wardrobe is amazing and Kate and Leo are phenomenal. Their acting = A+ \non this one, sad that this movie and Leo's performance was snubbed."
p40
aS"@DanPrinMan - the movie itself gets far more depressing than the trailer. \nIt's downright heartbreaking. Who'd want to watch it? Anyone interested in \nhow the human condition was affected by the historical and cultural moment \nexplored by the film. The 50s were a difficult time for many of that \ngeneration, often even those who were privileged by the system (middle \nclass white people). The novel was written as the 50s were unfolding and \nthe film captures the feelings beautifully."
p41
aS'@TheShnuz Hi, I think it is "Nina Simone - Wild Is The Wind"..'
p42
aS"Still can't believe that that's Leo and Kate. I mean, they were Jack and \nRose in Titanic, and now they're Frank and April Wheeler. And Frank and \nApril wind up hating each other, don't they? Oh, the irony!"
p43
aS'At the end, their house sinks and he lets go of her and disappears in to \nthe sand-box.'
p44
aS'@bellydancingdream - Wow, what a pompous way to say "I\'m right, you\'re \nwrong, so nyah." As for your accusation of "nostalgia," I don\'t have any \nfor the 50s. I wasn\'t born yet. I base my opinion on what I have read, seen \nand heard, created by people of the time - in other words, examining the \n"wider context," and being "open to individuals\' perspectives." Now, I\'m \nsure you have something better to do with your time than argue here. I know \nI do.'
p45
aS'dicaprio really get better as the time gets by, like a wine or somthing...'

aS"OMG it's titanic 2!!!! omg omg omg i didn't knew that the storie didnt \nend.... wtf wtf wtf NO WAY im gonna buy this movie!!! <=3 HOw is this \nposseble jack died right??/? and the old women no way "
p52
aS'This is a really good movie. Wow. The last 20 minutes are amaizing! And, \nthe song in the trailer is also amaizing, Wild is the Wind by Nina Simone.'
p53
aS'@lifedivinus, yes.'
p54
aS'the only thing more tragic than this film is leo and kate not winning oscars'
p55
aS"Are you serious? One of the points of Kate and Leonardo doing this film is \nso that people wouldn't label them together as Jack & Rose."
p56
aS'what were they both thinking when they decided to do a movie together , i \nwonder was it planned?'
p57
aS"nope. someone said it was a sequel.. Im just saying it's not. Cus it isn't. \nAre u really disagreeing?"
p58

p60
aS'This movie is kinda wat would of happend to Jack n Rose lol :)'

p63
aS'so thats what happened after titanic huh? lol'
p64
aS"in this movie they're not jack and rose they're frank and april.. and to be \nfair, she did do shep."

aS'@0SomebodyToLove0 thats why it is such a good movie. And yes its amazingly \nacted'
p71
aS"@midojaix87 Although I truly adore the novel, I would agree. Yes, living \nstatic and by all accounts mediocre life can leave you unsatisfied, but \nlike you said. No one's life is perfect and all of us have to accept that \non some level we will mostly be just ordinary. Is it fair to have to stifle \nthe urgency of your greatest aspirations? No. It's not. But that's life. If \nI were them I would just try to save for a trip to Paris. It won't be like \nliving there but at least I got to go."

aS"hah...this is a perfect example of alienation... I don't know you but i do \nfeel that you're alienated in the comfort of conventionality Midojaix"
p77
aS'No. She threw something. April (Kate Winslet) in the movie gave her \nsomething and she threw it in anger.'
p78
aS'Indeed, they survived the titanic disaster'
p79
aS"Is this good? I kinda wanna see it but I've heard mixed reports. Kate \nWinslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are my 2 favourite actors"

aS"@summerdying111 happy endings are never better because they are happy. \nHappy endings are a hollywood inventing. And most of all, happy endings \naren't better because they're not realistic. The best films almost never \nhave a happy ending. "
p83
aS'Great dmama film with two of my favorite actors DiCaprio and Winslet.They \nare both perfect in this movie.'
p84
aS'@TheCaptainOfLife How did it ruin your life? =o'
p85
aS'Well all in all I thought this was a really good movie but just a little to \ndepressing tho especially the ending.'
p86
aS"This movie kind of freaked me out. It's just so awful that some people are \nso miserable with the way their lives turned out and this is what happens. \nI had chills when it ended it was so good and somewhat depressing. They're \nboth amazing actors"
p87
aS'This is one of my favorite films. It inspires me to actually live my dream \nand to not get caught up in the "hopeless emptiness". Oh, and Kate Winslet \nis absolutely BRILLIANT!!!'
p88
aS"I'm not sure I understand why you all hate this movie so much. Kate Winslet \nis an amazing actress, who plays this part so well. Leo does an awesome \njob. The content of this movie far surpasses the quality of the Titanic. I \nthink this movie speaks to the life many Americans fall into due to social \npressures. The book that it is based on is a true masterpiece of American \nliterature. It is real. This situation plays out in American history. There \nis no happy ending it replicates true life."
p89
aS"finally, thank you! everyone seems to love them in this movie because it's \ntheir first time together since Titanic but I think they suck. & Titanic is \nmy favorite movie so I always thought they were really great in it."

p93
aS'nina simone wild is the wind'
p94
aS'this movie has three people from titanic in it !!!'
p95
aS"@kitycalifornia, I think it explores the idiocy & boredom of the 1950s \nsuburbs. While there are some universal themes in the story, it is set in a \nparticular time and place, that had its own spirit. It was a very difficult \nmoment in the history of the American family, partly because of the war and \nalso how people were struggling to define what the suburbs were going to \nbe. There was tremendous pressure to conform. Things aren't nearly as bad \nnow as they were then."
p96
aS'Bitter, nerve-wracking, ugly and relentless, Revolutionary Road is Big \nDrama done right, a mesmerizing look at desperate lives, wrong moves and \nspoiled dreams that hits hard right from the beginning and never lets up. \nVery sad and deep psychological drama. Amazing acting. '
