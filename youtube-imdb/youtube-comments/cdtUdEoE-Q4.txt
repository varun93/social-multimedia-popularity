aS'1) Under a court warrant issued by Magistrate Court on 17 November 2012 \nagainst the world HERO Barun, he was forced to go to the nearest mental \nhealth hospital on 21 Dec 2012 by a number of Police in order to testify \nhis COCAINE ADDICTION or NOT. The gap between his mock criminal advocacy \ntest which was held on 10 Dec 2012 and Police raid with the court warrant \nat his studio flat on 21 Dec 2012 was 10 days only.\n\n\n\n2) Barun\'s URINE and ECG tests were tactically testified by mental health \nhospital authority as soon as he reached there. The HERO was then \ntactically sectioned 2 under the mental health Act 1983. There were no \nspecific mental health issues identified by Psychiatrists against the world \nHERO except accusing him to send emails for help to his local MP.\n\n\n\n\n3) In his short reply, the HERO has recently told the BBC interviewer that \nmy former local MP replied my letter of 23rd July 2012 asking me to update \nhim all future progresses of my issues of an unofficial criminal \ninvestigation against me. What was my wrong for seeking his help by emails \nas neither he nor his office staff received my numerous calls and numerous \nvoice messages on his office and parliament numbers??\n\n\n\n\n4) How did I attend my MP\'s surgery at "Newham Town Hall Centre" on 01 \nSeptember 2012 and at "Stratford Picture House" in 2012 in a seminar on \nOlympic Games-2012 following my prior appointments from MPs office if I \nwould have mental health problems?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5) The BBC presenter has then appreciated the world HERO speculating, "you \nreally look like a MEGA politician but you don\'t seem to exercise your \npolitical policies for all the times. But I have been sure on one point \nabout you is that politicians across the world must have critical lessons \nfrom you due to their massive wrongs. I wish you good luck in your future \nlife.  May God help you too to be safe! Thank you to be staying with us \ntoday".'

p9
aS'People are not getting this... They picked Jeremy renner cause they might \nbe planning in the next Bourne movie Matt Damon(Jason Bourne) And Jeremy \nRenner(Aaron) the two of me might meet each other in the next Bourne movie \nso yo not thinking besides the two names are different Aaron Jason pls \nthink strait I do not want to offend anyone just think ok? K so in the next \nBourne movie it might be Australia or South America remember Aaron(Jeremy) \nand jason(Matt) might meet in the next movie so yea thnx for understanding.'
p10
aS"love the trilogy cuz there were a conclusion at the end of each film, but \nthis one felt like it was just building up the story through out the film \nand the end is definitely anticlimactic, this trailer is the most action \nyou'll prolly get in this movie considering its a bourne movie, maybe the \nfifth one could fix all the pint up ass kicking i was hoping to see, which \ni hope jenner would be in and maybe matt and jenner in the sixth film? i \nhave a feeling aaron cross is goin to look for jason bourne, he's a curios \none he'll definitely goin to seek the guy who started all this."

aS'MAAAAAAAAAAAAT DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMON! WHEEEEERE ARE YOUUUUUU? \nYOU ARE THE BEST ACTOR FOR JASON BOURNE'
p22
aS'Jeremy Renner was a great assassin in this and its a great action movie. \nBut for me the Bourne movies are great because Matt Damon was superb as \nJason Bourne. These are his movies and he is the star of the show. Its a \nshame he chose not to do the fourth because hes the main man! Matt Damon is \nthe guy who took on Treadstone and won!'
p23
aS'A "Bourne" movie is not really Bourne when they don\'t have Matt Damon in \nit!! So without seeing the movie I say it sucks'

p34
aS'i dontt like this aaron he looks shit for this movie jason was better, dont \nliket his movie'
p35
aS"It was a good movie in itself. The problem was that it renders everything \nJason Bourne did useless since they shut the program down & contained all \ndocuments. When watching Aaron Cross, I felt nervous the whole time but \nwatching Bourne you are completely relaxed because he is so stealthy. It \nwas a great movie but I expect closure in the next few and doing so \nrequires Bourne to be brought back again IMO & I'm not sure how that'll \nwork out. "
p36
aS"This piece of shit doesn't even deserve to be referred to as a Bourne \nmovie. It's a humiliation and ruins the whole series. All I can say to the \npeople that made this is : GO TO HELL, FUCKHEADS!!"

p38
aS'i really do hope they go with their word on making another Bourne film its \nobvious that matt Damon is returning for the next '
p39
aS'did u even understood what I have said you fucking idiot?'
p40
aS"Yeah I think that's true. But Aaron like Jason, thought hey you know what? \nI'm done with this. That's why the ending is like it is. But yeah if Aaron \ndid go after their organization, I don't think he would have been as \nmerciful as Jason was. He probably would literally burned the program to \nthe ground lol. But I don't know, think it was a deleted scene. Lol "
p41
aS"His character wanted out since the first movie. His main objective was to \nbring down the corporation he worked for. His plan didn't work 100% as you \ncan see in Legacy. Him and Renner's character have a chance of working \ntogether since they both want the same thing."
p42
aS'So disapionted , must have had the smallest budget of all the Bourne movies \n,, love the rest , trying to forget this one.....'

aS'very true . regards '

p52
aS"2:03 and 2:13. I didn't see those moments in the movie. Are those deleted \nscenes?"
p53
aS'The movie is supper fine in actual fact its fantastic hating it would be \nthe hardest thing all bourne movies are well spot on top class with quality \nand with everything the action fanatic want apart from matt damon missing I \nwould have really loved to see more of him. Otherwise for me I give the \nproduction all points!'
p54
aS'new tab...piratebay'
p55
aS'I think Matt Damon AND Jeremy Renner were great in their different roles. \nRenner is not Bourne, he is someone else. And Renner is in my opinion as \ngreat as Damon! It would be great to have them both fighting side by side...'
p56
aS'Exactly what the movie is about!!! And Jeremy is really good in it.'
p57
aS'I have read the reasons why Matt cant see his character being involved in \nfuture movies since his character wanted out of it all. The Bourne \nRetirement might not be that amazing to watch. '
p58
aS'Critics suck. In an age where there are very few decent action movies, this \nwas unfairly panned. '

aS'Just watched it, had amazing action and rather fast paced.. but when that \nThai assasin died I felt the movie was only halfway through but it ended \nthere! Bad ending.. story was good at 1st but it was like when you write an \nessay and you dont know how to continue so you just end it..'
p64
aS'Fuck me how I miss Matt in this one.'
p65
aS'I thought the same as many did... how can it be a Bourne movie without \nJason Bourne? But I really enjoyed it! I want to see Jeremy back in a \nsequel.'
p66
aS'I agree but overall the movie was not any better than the other Bourne \nmovies, anyway I watched it at hdcorner.tk for free so I had nothing to \nlose, they also allow you to download it but that feature is free for a \nlimited time only'
p67
aS'The Bourne series was already completed with Ultimatum. This stupid movie \nwas just a cash cow'

aS'Can anybody please tell me the music at 2:10 - 2:30? thanks! '
p69
aS'The title speaks volumes, basically its the fallout from what happened when \nTreadstone lost Jason Bourne.... The all freaked out when Pamela Landy got \na hold on the files, they are trying to cover there arses so they shut down \nall the programs that linked them to Treadstone, which basically means \nwiping out all the agents and the scientists that work for them.... I hope \nJason Bourne and Aaron Cross get together to take them out, probably before \nthat they should find out if there are any others.'

p78
aS'yes my Horizons are broad, that\'s how I am able to love this movie, and \nenjoy the other Bourne\'s despite that faggot that acts int he other ones. \nAnd just the fact that you equate fighting as "action" and none of the \nexplosions, thriller moments, chases, or gun fights as action then that \nshows me you\'re a closed minded little fuck. And there was a lot more \nfighting then the Mansion scene and chase at the end. And this whole movie \nkeeps talking about Jason Bourne, and the reasons for him not ther'

aS'Art is starting to imitate life now. Great movie and the best of the bourne \nseries in my opinion and not that far off from whats going on, if at all.'
p84
aS'For a moment I actually agree with you. There was a lot of potential, but \nthey fucked it all up. The Bourne movies focused on a man on the run from \nthe CIA. This shit is about a man after some stupid pills. Bullcrap'

p89
aS'the worst of the 4 movies (it wasnt as terrible as some people make it seem \nbut definitely a let down), yet it does have the best and most intense \ntrailer of them all. '
p90
aS'How come a Bourne movie comes out every time a new spiderman movie comes \nout? P.S I assume Jason Bourne is inspired by James Bond?'
p91
aS"The plotline doesn't make sense, if they had such super soldiers, why \ndidn't they just send them after Jason Bourne and then eliminate all of \nthem in one fell swoop, it would be like killing two birds with one stone. \nPlus the fight scenes were just too short for me, and the last scene with \nthe assassin didn't deliver like the scene with Jason Bourne vs Castle / \nDesh. They should have just continued with Jeremy Renner as Jason Bourne \ninstead. "
p92
aS"I also believe that Jeremy is the BEST man for the role & the HOTTEST to be \nAaron Cross. Matt Damon's role has been taken over by gorgeous \nJeremy!!!!!!!!!!!!"
p93
aS"Ok I get it, you don't like Matt Damon. But then, you can't compare this \npiece of shit to the Bourne films in terms of action and script, \nconsidering how pathetic and inferior it is. The script has nothing to do \nwith the Bourne movies, which is why everyone hates this stupid piece of \nshit. And what character development are you talking about? Hmm, just \npopping some pills here and there, and footage from the previous movies \njust to show us that its set in the same universe. Broaden your horizons"
