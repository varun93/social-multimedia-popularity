aS'*St. Vincent - coming out Oct. 10th!*\n\nThis trailer looked the most promising to me.  Not just because I love Bill \nMurray but because I love these kinds of stories...\n\n*Maggie, a single mother, moves into a new home in Brooklyn with her \n12-year old son, Oliver. Forced to work long hours, she has no choice but \nto leave Oliver in the care of their new neighbor, Vincent, a retired \ncurmudgeon with a penchant for alcohol and gambling. An odd friendship soon \nblossoms between the improbable pair. Together with a pregnant stripper \nnamed Daka, Vincent brings Oliver along on all the stops that make up his \ndaily routine - the race track, a strip club, and the local dive bar. \nVincent helps Oliver grow to become a man, while Oliver begins to see in \nVincent something that no one else is able to: a misunderstood man with a \ngood heart.*\n\n*Come on!  They had you at "pregnant stripper" and you know it!'
p6
aS" #BillMurray doesn't have an agent; he uses an 800-number to field acting \nrequests. Leave a voicemail and if he likes it, hell get back to you -- \nand it's a good thing the writer/director of #StVincent left more than 80 \nmessages because this #movie might nab Murray a second Oscar nod come award \ntime: exm.nr/1qUUSbk"
