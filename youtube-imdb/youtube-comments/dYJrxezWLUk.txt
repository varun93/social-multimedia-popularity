aS"Just watched *Oculus*, it's a great horror film. Mostly psychological, no \ngore. Recommended. 7/10"
p2
aS'I saw the movie and it was very original and idk I really liked it except I \nwas really pissed at the ending but it was creepy and it was good'
p3
aS'Watched this this week too.   Pretty good movie.  '
p4
aS"wow that was so bad. I'm so angry they got it so wrong. They had a good \ncast, and theme. but they wrecked this movie with the whole flash back \nconfusing ness. I didn't even see the movie in a series of events, it was \njust a flash back mixed into now thing. They could have just made the story \nof the children the movie but no they wanted to be creative. They got it \nall wrong. Don't watch it, my girlfriend is still mad at me for wasting 2 \nand a half hours of her life when she could have been watching friends"
p5
aS"I went into oculus not expecting it to be scary, but to be psychological. I \nreally liked the story and if it counts, the mirror is a great villain. I \nknew something bad would happen in the end. Won't spoil it though. If you \nwatch the movie for the story and not the horror, you'll be fine."
p6
aS"This movie fucks with your head. That's why it is pretty good. I love a \npsychological horror movie, rather than those that only have gore and \nbrainless scares. "
p7
aS'Overhyped and delivers poorly. Mediocre ending.\nVerdict : Never trust trailers. \nThe end.'
p8
aS"can someone explains I don't really get it. is the Dad the killer ?"
p9
aS'Hella boring and typical watched it with my girlfriend tonight and we both \nagree it just didn\'t deliver the trailer looked way better maybe we just \nhad too big of expectations.Seems like every horror movie now days is just \n"okay".'

p13
aS'1. Did Kaylie murder her fianc Michael ? 2. Did exist in 2002 computers \nwith flat screen? 3. Why they didnt use a simpler way to destroy the  \nmirror (by a gun)? 4. For one night they could not be dehydrated so they \ndidnt have to drink water every hour . Very low scariness of the film'
p14
aS"Finally a good horror movie, I really don't get why some people hate it so \nmuch"
p15
aS'rubbish and the funny movie i have ever  scene in my life  wastage of money \nand time garbagge movie bollywood s horor movies are far bettter than it'
p16
aS'Horror movies nowadays: \'we\'ve got a new home, lets check a \nbasement/attic/doll/mirror/bed/dish washer/beer can.."'
p17
aS"I don't see why people watch horror movies if they wanna be scared.\nThere isn't one movie i've seen in the past few years that i've been \nscared. The conjuring wasn't scary at all, it was just a good movie. This, \nlooks shit."
p18
aS'Best movie after Insidious !!!!'
p19
aS"So instead of breaking a cursed item that gets into your head and drives \nyou crazy, you want to prove that it is responsible for that even though it \ndoesn't leave any physical evidence and you install a death-trap to break \nit. Am i the only one who thinks this is a bad idea retarded even."
p20
aS'Good Movie x'
p21
aS'aburrimiento total no lo recomiendo a nadie, es una copia barata de espejo \nsiniestro'
p22
aS"I liked this movie, It's not very scary at the beginning but soon builds up \nto the climax and it does a really good job of making you not sure what is \nreal or fake, a lot of people are complaining about the ending but thats \nbecause they expected to be some sort of fairy tale bullshit but I thought \nit was an appropriate ending for a god horror movie 7.5/10"
p23
aS'Not the best, not the worst. This was an ok movie.'

p29
aS"*Oculus*\n\nA brother and sister return to the former familial home in which they \nwitnessed their parents' murder eleven years later. The brother has spent \nthe intervening years in a mental institution; the sister in foster care. \nOne is convinced that the source of the murders was the collapse of their \nparents' marriage and their simultaneous psychological breakdowns; the \nother believes that the murders were inspired by supernatural forces.\n\nWhich one is right?\n\nIs this a horror film or a psychological thriller?\n\nRent it for Halloween and enjoy finding out for yourself. (as well as Karen \nGillan's faultless American accent and great performances from Brenton \nThwaites, Katee Sackhoff and Rory Cochrane.)"
p30
aS"Thought this would be another shitty horror film...but honestly one of the \nbest scary movies I've seen in a long time...\n\nstoned af right now and that movie honestly scared the shit out of me.  \nWasn't a crazy concept or anything but still much different than the \ntypical horror film...thought provoking and a good, original story \nline...acting was good too compared to the typical horror performance. "
p31
aS'THIS IS A VERY GOOD MOVIE, PLEASE DONT READ STUPID ASS NEGATIVE COMMENTS.'
p32
aS'I saw this movie last night. I really enjoyed it. The ending made me want \nto punch babies it was so sad.'

aS"But how can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real?"
p39
aS'Movie came out April 11 of this year\n\nTen years ago, tragedy struck the Russell family,\nleaving the lives of teenage siblings Tim and Kaylie\nforever changed when Tim was convicted of the brutal\nmurder of their parents. Now in his 20s, Tim is newly\nreleased from protective custody and only wants to\nmove on with his life; but Kaylie, still haunted by that\nfateful night, is convinced her parents deaths were\ncaused by something else altogether: a malevolent\nsupernatural force  unleashed through the Lasser\nGlass, an antique mirror in their childhood home.\n\nDetermined to prove Tims innocence, Kaylie tracks\ndown the mirror, only to learn similar deaths have\nbefallen previous owners over the past century.\nWith the mysterious entity now back in their hands,\nTim and Kaylie soon find their hold on reality shattered\nby terrifying hallucinations, and realize, too late, that\ntheir childhood nightmare is beginning again.'
p40
aS'watched the movie. have mixed feelings. dont whether to like or hate it.\n                                why everyone hates this movie is becoz of \nthe ending. it could have been one of the best horror movies had the bro \nand sis succeeded in obliterating the mirror. '
p41
aS"Can anyone please tell me what the soundtrack was between 1:37 and 1:51 \nPLEASE!!! I tried to find it everywhere but I can't :("
p42
aS'wwe studios lame'
p43
aS'watched it today\nit was decent\nnot really scary tho\nbut aite non the less'
p44
aS"another mediocre horror, but better than the average of recent years...far \nfar far away from the Masters of the '80s, even mostly unknown like Lucio \nFulci"
p45
aS'ok movie.. terrible ending'
p46
aS"For Christ's sake Pond, call the Doctor!"
p47
aS'Absolute bollocks movie! good idea but just such a boring, non scary film, \nwhich was suppose to represent a horror. 3 out of 10 , the search continues \nfor a actual scary film.'
p48
aS'This was the best movie I have ever watched.'
p49
aS"I thought it was a great movie, i really liked it. By far one of the best \nmainstream horror movies for me, most of em that come out just don't cut it \nfor me. It was genuinely creepy and the psychological aspect of it was \ngood-- not to mention how twisted and gruesome some parts of it is. The \nonly thing that wasn't really explored about it was the origins of the \nforce behind the mirror and why it exists, I hope that they expand more on \nthat in the sequels (there better be one!! Grr the ending made me \nfrustrated). I feel that they made a good call not to do that here though, \nbecause I liked it the way it was. Can't wait for the second movie."
p50
aS'I love the light bulb part. :)'
p51
aS"Good story but the only part I didn't like is the ending. My ending of the \nmovie would've been that Keylie rigged the kill switch to trick the mirror \ninto thinking it was to break it but instead it sets off something else \nthat actually destroy the mirror. If Kaylie has been researching the mirror \nfor all those past years she should of found a way to destroy the mirror. \nShe should of known the danger and power the mirror possess and therefore \nbe able to beat it. Throughout the movie she was only playing along to make \nthe mirror believe they were falling into the mirrors tricks. A happy \nending would of made the movie great."
p52
aS"So this is Amy's life without the doctor... "
p53
aS'Props this shit was awesome movie'
p54
aS'SPEEEEEDDDDDDDDDD'
p55
aS"They don't make horror films like they used to.... the plotline has been \ndone 1000 times since the original exorcist. Nothing in this movie existed \noutside of a house... and the transitions from their past to present were \nreally shaky.... poop 4 out of 10."
p56
aS'This seems to be quite the love/hate type of film.'
p57
aS'watched it ... that mirror is an Uchiha clearly ... his casting genjutsu \nall over the place'
p58
aS'Looks amazing'
p59
aS"So it's the mirror of erised from Harry Potter....... But bad? "
p60
aS'1:56 Which is why I never eat apples.'
p61
aS"Bad movie, bad ending. I feel it didn't have enough time to explain more \nabout the mirror and how it was doing what it was doing."
p62
aS"After seeing this I really don't wan't any mirrors in my room"
p63
aS'I think it was a brave choice to use Karen Gillan for a horror movie role, \nespecially after her work on Doctor Who. I thought she was a great fit yet \nstrange to see a sci-fi series actress in a horror movie! Her delivery \nthroughout the film was average.'
p64
aS'I loved her in Doctor Who. "My raggedy man!" she would call Matt Smith\'s \ndoctor. Tops all around.'
p65
aS'im not one for horror movies as they dont scare me...until now,good story \nwhich tends to play on your mind during and a bit after wards..watch with a \nfriend'
p66
aS'I really liked this movie. Plus the fact that Karen Gillian was in it \n(sorry, I might have spelled her name wrong)'

p74
aS'Sad ending'
p75
aS'i just watched this movie it was dumb confusing and didnt explian anything \nwhy was the mirror evil or curst never tells you in the movie '
p76
aS"I expected so much more from this movie... It was absolutely the kind of \nhollywood horror movie you would expect... not scary, way too much \npredictable.. I don't know how anyone can say it was a good horror movie.. \nbut it was not.."
p77
aS'Boring and predictable. Took me almost a week to finish watching because I \nkept falling asleep. '
