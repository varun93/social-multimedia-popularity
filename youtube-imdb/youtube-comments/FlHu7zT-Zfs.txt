S"Hey +Dan Petrovic what' you think?"
p1
aS"A former soldier is taken captive and awakens in the back of a van to learn \nhe only has a few moments to figure out how he got there. It's a unique \nconcept set in the near future that explores the idea of mind control."
p2
aS"The movie is good, it has some mistakes here and there and they could make \nit much much better with their plot idea, but it's good"
p3
aS"ohhh no its another Noel Clark shit fest . Bless him he does try , But i \nthink I made my mind up within 5 seconds. I'll pass . Up there with Vinnie \nJones and Luke Goss for making hot steaming piles of poo\n\nNothing worse than I self obsessed director who puts himself in the lead \nroles"
p4
aS"Utter crap and only watchable if you're asleep, the hero is just a vain \nposer showboating, whoever's paid towards the making of this tripe ought to \nbe shot, movie don't make any sense, sad waste of money"
p5
aS'The setup looks good, the quality looks ok, the trailer however, is \nabominably bad! \nWorst among the offenses (bad cuts, confusing, no money shots etc) was \nshowing the female lead not once but twice(!) in the same naked pose, once \nwhen her name was shown! Because apparently that\'s the sole reason for her \ncharacter to be in the movie I guess.\nI love "Mickey" to Trensalore and back, but unless they give me a better \ntrailer this is a pass.'
