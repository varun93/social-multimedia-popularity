aS'Is not a hollywood movies also in the box office, but can be said pretty \ngood movie. Have a quite simple moral message.. which is teaches us, \nespecially to the married couples out there to don\'t ever cheating and \nhaving affair especially when your partner is the loyal type and really \nloves you. Never dared to married if you can\'t make a commitment. In this \nway there will be nobody feelings will get hurt. Btw, the sex scene when \n"David (Rupert Evans)" sees his wife "Alice (Hannah Hoekstra)" having sex \nwith her secret lover is very hot thou.. XD.'
