S'Loved Machete 1, but couldn\'t watch this one for 10 mins, Even high. The \nplot starts sci-fi from the beginning (turn-off), Charlie looks like he\'s \nsobering from a high and forgot how to act.. plethora of explosions, seen \none, seen em all.. same punchlines with "machete this, machete that", lost \nit\'s comedic value. "Machete don\'t tweet". Oh really, what\'s next, Machete \ndon\'t Google plus? Atleast stay original. The first chapter had a storyline \nand semi-realistic until the end. This is like someone vomitted the first \nchapter all over again, but worse. And now I hear Gaga was in this shit.. \nwhat the... this has to be the biggest C grade flick with A grade actors \never produced.. Congrats Tarantino...'

aS'Machete, go kick some ass'
p2
aS'Carlos Estevez looks a lot like Charlie Sheen. '
p3
aS"These are such great movies. A high quality production made to look like a \nearly 70's low budget grindhouse film with excellent big name actors doing \ngreat cameos. And Danny Trejo is always great onscreen presence as well. \nOne of the tough guy actors of all time.- What great filmmaking these are! \nPure film as an art! A movie for people who love movies!"
p4
aS"Finally got around to watching Machete Kills. This is the hardest movie \nI've worked on. Just watching it made my back hurt, hahaha! Look for me in \nthe credits, Rigging Electric Best Boy.\n\n#MacheteKills"
p5
aS'another one I heard nothing but shit about. and it was shitty. but I dont \nknow if it was because it was 2 in the morning but I had no problems with \nit being shitty. It was just a wacky mishmash of almost-stories like Planet \nTerror with Mel Gibson. Mel Gibson, who act as looney as he did in South \nPark is pretty fun to watch.'
p6
aS'The majority of the budget went into funding celebrity cameos and that *one* \npractical effects explosion at 1:31. The rest of the film was done with \nairsoft rifles and after effects.'
p7
