S"I've grown to love the art style. The colourful painted sculpture-esque \nlook is a really refreshing alternative to the realistic doll-like \nanimation (which I still like in moderation) that they've been recycling \nfor so many years now. It actually took me and others a couple minutes to \neven tell Entangled apart from Frozen the one time. I prefer variety and \ntaking risks to simply using the same old which is safe but boring after a \nwhile."
