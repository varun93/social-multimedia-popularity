S"While by no means, I thought this was a very good movie overall. A good \nenough plot so you didn't have to be an x-file fan to enjoy it, and plenty \nof nods for the fans."
p1
aS"I just saw a Mitch Pillegi interview where he said Robin Williams showed up \non set once and was really nice (although Mitch wasn't there to meet him). \nI would have loved for him to be a creepy bad guy in a monster of the week \nepisode. Like the scariest, most formidable motw they ever had. That would \nhave been awesome and more horrifying than John Lithgow's Trinity in \nDexter."
p2

p13
aS'well mabey in the tv show of the x files is were all the alien shit was and \nin the first movie because if you look up " The X-Files: I want to belive", \nit shows up as " The X-Files 2"'
p14
aS'I liked the IWTB very much.It felt like an extended episode,rather than a \ncontinuation of FTF. '
p15
aS"I find it incredibly annoying that most of the fans really don't give a \nshit about her and to be honest they never understood the flipping' show!"
p16
aS'Xzibit!<3'
p17
aS"At least if the third film EVER gets made it will deal with the \ncolonization date! but really they should if anything do like a two-part \nstraight to dvd sequel or something! lord knows i'm dying for it."
p18
aS"Damn, I grew up with this show. I haven't seen the movie, but judging from \nthe reviews, I don't think I ever want too."
p19
aS"@ dead skulls---I think the movie did well. I am a huge X-Phile, but the \nmovie just came out at the wrong time; 2 weeks after the Dark Knight, it \nbeing a Summer release when it should have a Winter release. Plus, Chris \nCarter told the fans back in 98 that they were talking about another movie \nand it wasn't going to be about the Mythology. Time and time again, Carter \nsaid that the movie wasn't gonna be about aliens. People go and see it, and \nare upset that it wasn't about aliens. Are yo serious?"
p20
aS"For those of us who have been X-Files fans since the beginning, this movie \nlooks intriguing. I'm anticipating watching it."
p21
aS'Yeshua ha Mashiach, died on the cross for your sins as according to the \nScriptures, on the 3rd day He raised again And that he was seen of Cephas, \nthen of the twelve: After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren \nat once; of whom are fallen asleep.After that, he was seen of James; then \nof all the apostles. And last of all he was seen of Paul also, as of one \nborn out of due time. (Like when I saw Him) If you repent and trust him, \nyou will have eternal life and reign w Him in His Kingdom.'
p22
aS'The X Files: I Want to Believe. That this movie was good but you cant have \nagent Mulder and Scully discovering the truth of an alien virus and being \nin contact with aliens.Then them trying to catch guys conducting stem cell \nresearch wrong move Chris Carter.'
p23
aS'WTF? I thought this movie was about aliens abuducting people and shit like \nthat? I just saw it today and I was kinda disapionted'
