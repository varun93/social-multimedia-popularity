p1
aS"Sorry for the random comment, but this has been on my mind for a while. \nRemember that song and music video Mary J. Blige and Ludacris made called \nRunaway Love? Anyway, if you haven't seen the vid, go watch it so you know \nwhat I'm talking about. I wish they would make movies out of those plots. I \nknow the baseline of them have already been done, so that's why I mean \nEXACTLY like those plots. Just sayin'"
p2
aS'Elizabeth Olsen seems to be quite the actress. I wonder if any of that \nrubbed off from her older twin sisters :)'
p3
aS'Thats right kids life only matters between 15 & 25. Sex is only exciting \nthen. Love is only deep then. After 25 you should just disappear and die. \nlol It looks like a nice movie , but at what point will we stop catering \nburning love to kids only? Oh well. '

p21
aS"After watching all those trailers, I now know that all american \npseudo-intellectual indie films are about young upper middle class white \npeople being fragile and emotional and having problems.\n\nBecause people of color never have problems. Ever. They're just here to \nplay the stereotypical nurse/fast food waitress/ whatever small part there \nis or just you know, just be the wise big black woman who talks really loud \nand has great advice for the white girl protagonist."

p45
aS"this was terrible. i wish i wasnt saying that but it was so bad. (spoiler \nalert i guess??)  i swear the guy had like 2 lines and the rest of the time \nhe just gave the girls a dreamy look and they kissed him. they didn't \ndevelop his personality at all so it was weird to think 2 girls could fall \nin love with a guy who didn't do anything except bite his lip and stare at \nthem then kiss them like 10 times in the movie. just really stupid. i \nwanted to like it because of the girls in it but it was shit.

Lol\nI'll probably still enjoy the movie though:)"
