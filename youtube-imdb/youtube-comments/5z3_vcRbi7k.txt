p15
aS"What's with this sudden purge of big actor's movies all of a sudden? may be \nsudden purge of good movies too? Does all these big fame actors decided to \nget off their asses at the same time?"
p16
aS'Seems good. Looks like a movie I would watch in theaters.'
p17

aS'Its nothing like "Prisoners". Completely different scenarios! Watch them \nboth, you\'ll see the differences.'
p37

p68
aS'Might as well remake Vanishing with Kiefer Sutherland.'
p69
aS'the worst kind of bad clich movie!!! and really really unintentionally \ntoo. such bullshit. watch the danish movie "The Hunt" instead!!!, or "The \nKeeper of Lost Causes. much better.'
p70
aS'Kind of Prisoners rip off.................but way lower quality on \neverything.'

p74
aS"Another one of those movies where the main character (the good guy and the \nvictim) gets blamed for everything he didn't do, and no one believes him \nfor some strange reason.\n  \nI really don't get why movies do this.. Frustration isn't a good emotion \nfor the viewer to have for such a long period of time, it just isn't \nrewarding in any way to get the good ending after mountains of unnecessary \nshit and stupidity.\n\nActing was good and the plot was good, just poorly executed."

p85
aS'filmed in my city, so awesome to see some Sudbury people in it'
p86
aS'all you morons that say this is too much like prisoners are just \nidiots...So I guess any movies involving a kidnapping is the same and cant \nbe told totally differently again?'
p87
aS'worst film i have ever watched EVER! i hated it\nclearly the director watch prisoners 2013 and thought i want to do that\nAtom Egoyan should retire'
p88
aS'One of the top 10 worst movies that I have ever watched. Horrible acting, \nno directing at all, writing was the worst and the worst of the worst the \nediting.\nThey should burn the original copy and portend that it has never happened.'
