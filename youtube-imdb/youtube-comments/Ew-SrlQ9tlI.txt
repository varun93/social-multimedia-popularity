aS'First of all.

p32
aS"I saw this today and I think (my opinion anyway) that we're intended to \nfeel some empathy with the four (actually 5) muslim terrorists, as well as \nboth laugh at the incidents and register the darkness of it as well.  I \nthink the film succeeded in walking a very fine line as well as it could. \n The actors were all very good and there must have been improvisation as \nwell."
p33
aS'very funny movie ...'
p34
aS"Great film. I don't know what the writers and directors got from it, but I \nhad it picked as a film about guys that are gullible and trying to do what \nthey think they're supposed to do. Funny, sad, tragic. Worth a watch for \nsure. "
