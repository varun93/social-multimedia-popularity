p16
aS'I am IRON MAN! black sabbath baby'
p17
aS'iron man 2 is one of the weakest marvel movies and this trailer reveals the \nwhole movie'
p18
aS'I like ironman 2(the only thing that isn t good in it is the guy playing \njustin hammer)  in fact i like all the ironmans movies i like the sequels \nmore then the first one'

aS'2 : 20 was really cool'
p30
aS' '
p31
aS"Iron Man 2 is like all Iron Man Movies perfect! I can't understand why so \nmany people say that the first one is better. Iron man 2 shows the \nemotional sickness and the other sides of being a superhero. Iron man is \nTHE best comic movie. It's funny, smart and robert downey jr plays this \nrole perfect. Everything fix together that why i love marvel movies "
p32
aS'Some things in this trailer I definitely did not see in the movie'
p33
aS"I had a random dream about an Iron man 4 trailer. I don't know why since I \ndid nothing Marvel related that day. Maybe it's because Iron Man 2 and Iron \nMan 3 left a big gaping hole of un-satisfaction. "
p34
aS'Awesome fuckin movie!'
p35
aS'iron  man  plese  see'
p36
aS"I've made an epic dubstep sync with this movie, check it out if ya want ;) \nyou wont regret it"
p37
aS'Hey guys,please first read this before hating it or flagging it as spam ! I \njust started to make clean bass boosted videos,for example #thatPower : \n/watch?v=DHGXFIeDW2E But I need to make some advertising so I can get any \nviews or even subscribers,so I\'m posting this under known Videos on YouTube \nhoping to be noticed by some guys who like bass and music. And please don\'t \njust answer "No" or something like that,I\'d just like to become a bit \nbigger. '
p38
aS"I disagree. I liked Part 2 more. It introduced War Machine, had a great \nperformance from Mickey Rourke and a better plot. The story was too \nconfused and forced in Part 3. Just don't get me started on all that Iron \nPatriot crap!"
p39
aS'Whats the song with the guitar solo'
p40
aS'whats the song at the end of the trailer?'
p41
aS'because its the best :D'
p42
aS'haha the funny thing is, the black guy went into his house and stole his \nstuff. ahHAHAH classic...'
p43
aS'Iron Man 3 sucked. Thought it would be epic. Completely no feel like the \nfirst 2 movies. '
p44
aS"But then it wouldn't be finised would it? Naah shiet."
p45
aS'worst... movie... ever...'
p46

p57
aS'Nuestro IRON MAN particular, de Tomelloso, persiguiendo al malechor en el \nasfalto...'
p58
aS'the second of your wish list MG'
p59
aS'Yeah this movie isn\'t as good as the first one but it does have its \nmoments, for example " my greatest creation speech" from Howard Stark. I \nlike the fact that they showed Iron man isn\'t perfect he has issues but he \nfaces his challenges head on when he\'s ready to. The only thing that really \nannoyed me about Iron Man 2 was Justin Hammer. He wasn\'t that strong of a \ncharacter. Obadiah Stane will always be the best villain in the Iron man \nseries. The Mandarin would have come in as a equal to Stane if they hadn\'t \nscrewed up the ending. -_-'
p60
aS'war machine had about the same time as Spiderman 3 venom. yet war machine \nwas able to demonstrate more without looking flawed,'
p61
aS'Cool!'
p62
aS"i got into comics/superhero/marvel/dc at 18 so about 2008. I must say it \nwas a good time to get into comics. \n\nsince 2010 Marvel has been doing great. 2 THOR , 2 Cap, an avenger movie, 3 \niron man's, guardians, upcoming widow, panther, strange movies, x-men \nmovies, spider man movies, upcoming inhumans, netflix's heroes for hire, \ndaredevil,...\n\nWOW."
p63
aS'iron man is copy of real stroy it will be\nmean gravity of moon broken gravity of light'
p64
aS'This is the more action packed Iron Man sequel compared to the first,:P'
p65
aS'Agreed.'
p66
aS'This trailer was so fucking awesome! Well done to whoever made it!'
p67
aS'I think iron man 2008 was the best over 2 and 3'
p68
aS'Yes Iron mAn'
p69
aS' tigreHHH. You no what fuck you cause you dont no anything about movies \nthis was a awesome movie all the iron mans are and your a stupid piece of \nshit 1st off if this movies so bad why did it make 623 mill 2nd if its so \nbad why is robert downey jr the 1st actor ever to make 100 mill for one \nmovie think about that you shit face fag'
