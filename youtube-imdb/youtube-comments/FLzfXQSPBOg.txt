S'Nothing can compete with Wall-E in my heart.'
p1
aS"This is an example on why trailers shouldn't be trusted. This made it seem \nlike Frozen was going to be like a Tangled on winter, when in fact the \nmovie is probably the 'darkest' Disney has released so far."
p2
aS'Everything Frozen did, Tangle did better.'
p3
aS'As much as I enjoyed this movie, I personally think it was WAY overrated. '
p4
aS'The songs are over-hyped,  the movie\'s over-hyped...Tangled was better, but \nabove both of these movies, I would chose Princess and the Frog any day. \nSorry I don\'t agree with all of your "superior" opinions about a Disney \nPrincess movie that bored me half to death and was just as special as any \nother Disney movie.'
p5
aS'Mulan was better hands down.'
p6
aS'1:18=did Kristoff just say "fastypants" to Anna???'
p7
aS"What's wrong with Frozen?\n....People think it's overrated....\n...It's a great movie, if you ask me...\n:T"
p8
aS'Frozen: Esta es una pelcula que nos ensea la importancia del amor en \nfamilia..  '
p9
aS"Before I saw this movie (I never saw the theatrical trailers), I knew Elsa \nwasn't a villain, despite her image. I didn't know what she was, but she \nwas a good person"
p10
aS'This was the greatest movie Disney ever produced. Way to go guys; \nconstantly maintaining and improving the quality of animation even years \ndown the road. This was the perfect movie, and most likely, nothing will \never surpass it.'
p11
aS"I enjoyed the movie itself...but compared to this, the trailer's awfully \nmisleading. Some of the clips were either edited or not even put into the \nfinal movie."
p12
aS"Worst movie ever who's with me-G"
p13
aS'this was very misleading'
p14
aS'I know that I am in a minority here but I did not see what was so special \nabout this movie.\nI saw it and it was fun.\nNothing special to me at all.\nI liked Wreck It Ralph and Tangled before it a lot more.\nThe songs were a bit catchy tho...'
p15
aS'i really hate how much people praise this movie'
p16
aS'How could they compare this with The Lion King? Are they blind or confused? \nTLK has the bar still very high for it.'
p17
aS"Before I saw this movie (I never saw the theatrical trailers), I knew Elsa \nwasn't a villain, despite her image. I didn't know what she was, but she \nwas a good person"
p18
aS'Disney makes some of the worst movies. That movie looks like crap.'
p19
aS"If somebody tells me this is the best animated musical ever again, I'll \ngladly point them to The Nightmare Before Christmas. It crushes this in \nevery way possible."
p20
aS'actually i heard alot about the movie, but after watching it..... well,it \nwas nice but not the best disney movie'
p21
aS"There it is ;) Don't forget to watch let it go! 24/7"
p22
aS"Why did they make this trailer seem dramatic with the movie announcer voice \nin the beginning?... it's supposed to be a fun kids movie!!"
p23
aS"I was quite surprised when Elsa didn't turn bad at the end of the film but \nstill enjoyed it. The Snow Queen was originally an antagonist and I hope \nthat subsequent sequels will chart her transition into the villain we all \nlove. It would be good if she doesn't become a traditional villain but \ninstead transforms into a complex, misunderstood antagonist we can relate \ntoo. Who says 'kid films' cannot be mature?"
p24
aS' I HATE FROZEN. And proud of it. ^-^ Seriously there are way better \nmovies than that and way better sisterly movies too like Lilo and Stitch \nand Tinker Bell: The Secret Of The Wings. THIS MOVIE IS OVERRATED AND \nANNOYING AND HAS PLOTHOLES. And boy do I hate Jelsa! :P Although credits to \nDisney for one good thing. This animation is flawless. '
p25
aS'overrated by hipster douchebags'
p26
aS'Hate it, that this trailer was not dubbed in German q.q We just have two \nofficial trailers for Frozen "Die Eisknigin"!\nThis is my favourite trailer!'
p27
aS'I love it!'
p28
aS"0:40 That's not what he says!"
p29
aS'Rule one of the Internet: Stay off the comments section.'
p30
aS'is it just me that finds elsa kinda hot?'
p31
aS"I actually thought this trailer sucked. It didn't make me hyped up 4 the \nmovie. The movie was a thousand times better than what i had expected. Go \nwatch it :) or buy the DVD"
p32
aS'evry time i say to my self cmon i am gonna watch this movie, but mom is \nasleep she also wants to watch it and sometimes mom says no not the \nsuitable time \n\nbut at last i watched it and its kinda awesome :l umm not that much but it \nis'

aS'" Some people are worth melting for "'
p34
aS'every time I see this it brings me shivers.. I think Elsa has gotten me \nchills... *pun intended*'
p35
aS'Ehdf'
p36
aS'this movie is so overated '
p37
aS"This trailer is so perfect for the tone of the entire movie, the way it's \nso silly and then gets so dramatic."
p38
aS'the way anna sings a chance to find true love at @1 58 they show hans \ntalking with elsa. its like they wanted us to think hans was elsas true \nlove.'
p39
aS'But one day she Let It Go.......tell me about it!!!'
p40
aS'The more is funny okay'
p41
aS"its really damn annoying how people are commenting that they hate the movie \nand comparing it to other movies. it sounds a lot like they're trying not \nto be mainstream and go against the norm and be cool is all. yes, they \nreally may like other movies better, but commenting and comparing this to \nother movies s to purposely go against the popular opinion. they mention \nthe hype, success, music, etc. but do they do that with every movie they \nsee? nope. it sounds to me like a just to be different."
p42
aS'well i like the trailer "opening" song  , it\'s sound really cool '
p43
aS"I don't like this movie. Seems to common. But it's good for children \nthough. :)"
p44
aS'sniper elite 4 25 october 1944 ww2'
p45
aS"I am still very surprised that this is the highest grossing animated film \nin the world. I wouldn't call it directly bad, but far from entertaining, \nboth for children and adults with only one good song it it."
p46
aS'Firstly we all tot elsa is the evil 1 but not till the end did we actually \nreally know who is then the evil 1 and plot such a despicable plan to rise \nto power'
p47
aS'When I saw that this was from the creator of tangled, I was so excited. \nWhen I watched the actual movie.......not so appealing. But animation was \ngood. The story didn\'t suck but I expected more from Disney.  This is \nactually loosely based on the famous fable/fairy tale "the snow queen".'

aS"Disneys Frozen Review\nFrozen is heart melting film which will have you singing and dancing out of \nyour seat. This Disney Classic entails  a winter wonderland adventure \n complimented by good moral messages throughout.  \nWhen a prophecy traps a kingdom in eternal winter, Anna, a courageous \noptimist, teams up with Kristoff and his sidekick reindeer Sven both \nexperience mountain men ,  go on an epic journey to find Anna's sister \nElsa, the Snow Queen, and put an end to her icy spell.  \nThrough their adventures they encounter mystical trolls, spellbound snowmen \nand much much more! The score and music is grand and  compliments the \namazingly detailed  animation .  I highly recommend this movie , its \n perfect for all ages as it will have you smiling , singing and letting it \ngo throughout this whole frozen adventure. "
p51
aS"At first, when I watched this trailer..I'm like, typical Disney film. But \nafter watching the movie..DAMN! awesome!!"

aS"how does Elsa has powers and I don't "
p62
aS"If Anna is a red hair.....why doesn't she have freckles?"
p63
aS'1:40.... there is that scene in the movie?'
p64
aS'i dont know why or how other people judge this,, well we have our own \nopinion right? and for me, i looove this movie<3 i love the story.'
p65
aS"What i love about this movie is Elsa's character development. She begins \nafraid of herself, believing she is a 'curse' and a monster, but she learns \nto love herself. Also, it is clear that she has anxiety issues."
p66
aS'Y\n..'
p67
aS'Frozen is so good'
p68
aS"And of course, the whole animated movies fandoms are overjoyed and excited \nabout this movie. Elsa reminds me of the newest Jack Frost, like a girl \nversion of him. Obviously she's not, but they could be friends. I bet Elsa \nand Jack would get along great, since they can both conjure up winter \npowers. It's interesting since Jack can control them, but Elsa can't, or so \nit seems based on this clip."
p69
aS"I don't think it will be nearly as good as LK, though they used that \ncomparison to increase revenue."
p70
aS"ELSA is perfect!! Can't wait to see this movie!!"

p74
aS'Got to admit. ?. LOVE DIS MOVIE...\nBUT...\nThe story line is\nAnna teams up with\n- Her sister\n- A hansome guy\n- A snowman\nAns a merchant\nTo defeat\n- Her sister\n- A hansome guy\n- A snowman\nAns a merchant'

aS'My second favorite Disney movie the first one is Peabody and Sherman'
p81
aS"There's a lot of songs in frozen let it go for the first time in forever I \nforgot all"
p82
aS'That scene of Elsa as a villainish character should have been in the movie, \nit would have made it a lot more.... Awesome. But I still loved the movie.'
p83
aS'Ill be honest. I prefer this Elsa version of the trailer over the regular \nversion...namely because it seems more intense when the singing starts in \nthe second half. The song was much more appropriate.'
p84
aS'Why does there has to be SINGING in it? :-s'
