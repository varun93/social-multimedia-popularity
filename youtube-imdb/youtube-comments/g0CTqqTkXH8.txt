p56
aS'Bob Bergen as Fireflies '
p57
aS"@ksyalicious If you notice, Iridessa's clothes are completely different, \ntoo. Unfortunately, it seems to just be a habit Disney is getting into with \nall the Tinkerbell movies. I just got the third one and about half of the \ntrailer for that was also of clips not actually in the finished movie. All \nare still good, but it's a little sad that the trailers tend to look like \nthey're for a more interesting and unique story than we actually get. '^^"
p58
aS'i Love Tinkerbell ! [:'
p59
aS'Teker bell'
p60
aS"what's the name of this movie? i've watched the movie called 'tinkerbell' \nbut there's clips that not showed in the movie."

aS"But why are ALL the other movies different from their trailers? Not that \nthey weren't good. "
p64
aS"HAI!!! The story line must be good...that's what matters!!!"
p65
aS"they didn't put in tinker bell's voice oh well,cute movie :)"
p66
aS"The other movies were more so like their trailers than the first one. But \nto answer your question I think it's because for the Disney Fairies movies \nthey create the trailer before the movie is even halfway done. :)"
p67
aS"I just noticed that change. I'm not sure if I like it or not. They must \nhave been going for a more realistic looking face rather than a cartoonish \nface with large eyes. I think they should have just stuck with the original \nanimated tinkerbells looks."
p68
aS'almost every clip is not in the movie... what kind of trailer is this??'
p69
aS'i love tinker bell because shs a beautiful fairy when i was a baby(1) year \nold i still love her until grow up(30) years old said my mom only thirty \nyears ols'
p70
aS'tinkerbell is great!!!!!!!!!'
p71
aS"For everyone who's confused on why the trailer is nothing like the movie, \nand why their eyes are so big, I'll explain. See, the original version of \nTinker Bell was 80% done, but a new guy was put in charge and he hated how \nit was done- the graphics, plot, etc. so he completely changed it. They \neven switched the voice of Tink! Oh well..."
p72
aS"some of these clips aren't in a movie."
