p9
aS"This is my first time seeing this... don't know anything about the \nseries....\n\nBut mannnn does this look awesome"
p10
aS"Just saw it. It's a prequel. I won't do spoilers but my guess is they will \nreboot and go forward from this new point in the timeline. I thought it was \n3D but I think It's still being done in 2D but it's a bit more vivid. I \ndon't know if that's a tech issue or holding to tradition.\n\nWorth watching and Appleseed fans will anyway."

aS'They should really consider making this series into a game. Soldiers + \nmechs is definitely underrated (I can only think of Titanfall) but has lots \nof potential. Plus the visuals look really good.'
p22
aS'All that rough and tumble combat gear to go with a gritty setting....and a \nboob window.'

p37
aS'Looks like a Metal Gear Solid spin-off made with PS2 graphics..'
p38
aS"This would have been awesome 10 years ago. But now, given the advancements \nin gaming and CGI Movies like Avatar. It's unimpressive. It looks like a \nXbox1 or PS4 game with bad motion capture. It looks old."
p39
aS'OMG! I gotta get this. I love and own all the Appleseed movies.  '
p40
aS'yuck! Music and edit do not equal good art direction. Open it up to fans to \ndo the next one. Just give them the music to edit to and you will get \nsomething better then this.'
