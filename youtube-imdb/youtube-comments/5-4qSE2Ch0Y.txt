S"Is it just me or has Rick O'Connels character changed alot"
p1
aS"Half-decent movie. But it's just not the same without Rachel Weisz. Bello \ndid the best job she could, but Weisz simply IS Evelyn O'Connell."
p2
aS"I totally love this movie. Alex O'Connell who is Rick and Evelyn's son, he \nbecame an adult, and he's good for killing lots of bad guys and mummies."
p3
aS'*The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor* (2008)\n\n#themummy3  '
p4
aS'I thought so too.Rick was cool,fun,"kick ass alpha male" in first two Mummy \nfilms. Now boring. I don\'t like the replacement on Evy. Huge mistake.The \nnew one her accent is so fake. 2nd mistake Alex. He\'s like half same age as \nhis dad for real he\'s supposed to be a teenager. They should have take the \nkid who played Alex in part 2.Jonathan to me he got so mature. 3rd really \nhuge mistake was Imhotep was not in it. It would\'ve been more exciting \nbesides some dumb ancient Chinese mummy.'
p5
aS'i hate it how they Changed the actress that plays Evy in the other two \nMummy movies...smh'
p6
aS'Still, I liked it!! :D'
p7
aS'the mummy 4 was cancelled!!!! instead "the mummy 1999" was be \nremade!!!!!!!!!'
p8
aS'the new one was pretty hot to'
p9
aS"I liked the mummy 1 and 2 :) that's it "
p10
aS'Such a disappointment...'
p11
aS'The Mummy 4 would take place at Mayan Pyr4amid??'
p12
aS'do you people not like jet li or something because a lot of people tend to \nhate on this movie'
p13
aS'2.06 when did that happen in the movie!!!!!!'
p14
aS'Oh what could have been...'
p15
aS'i hate this movie and the second too, the first one was great.'
p16
aS'Like if you think Brendan Fraser is underrated :)'
p17
aS"so they still didn't give up the freaky narrating voice, eh?"
p18
aS"i thought this movie sucked cos rachel weisz wasn't in it, and alex spoke \namerican"
p19
aS"I've seen Tomb of the Dragon Emperor once or twice on FX ( I think ). While \nI wasn't blown away by it, it was still good just as an action adventure \nmovie with some history & mysticism tossed in. Certainly a better movie \nthan something like Indiana Jones 4 ( W / was not a total waste, but not as \ngood as the 1st 3 ). "
p20
aS'Horrible! The first 2 movies were so great! Then they make this?!? \nUghhhhhh... Stupid movie.'
p21
aS'My two favorite lines from the movies are: 1. After the guy said he was to \ncheap to buy seat belts *laughs* and Fraser: Ha ha ha Why am I laughing? 2. \nJohnathan: I hate mummies. They never play fair.'
p22
aS'Brendan Fraser: Legend of the Mummy Fighter (meaning that he rocks).'
p23
aS'never saw this movie in the theaters. Probably never will see it PERIOD.'
p24
aS'I found the characters changed to much.. I realize they cannot keep redoing \nImhotep even though the Egypt aspect makes for more exciting material then \nChina. They turned Rick into a boring dad, he used to be a kick ass alpha \nmale..alex was annoying and to old..Johnathan actually was written annoying \nwhere he was funny before. Evie wa just wow so awful..as soon as I saw her \nrunning around at the beginning with a sword playing I knew this was going \nto be bad. Mummy One was creepish and chilling.'
