S'I usually am no fan of vampire movies. I also have not read any of the \nbooks. However, I watched the first movie in this Saga and was hooked. I \neventually watched each following installment and had seen everything \nexcept Twilight; Breaking Dawn Part 2 [BD2] ... until this morning. \nYesterday was my Birthday and today I bought myself a Gift. I enjoyed each \ninstallment of the Saga individually, and as a continuing, unfolding Story. \nI enjoyed BD2 the most and found it an Awesome Finale to the Saga.\n\nI Highly Recommend the Saga in its entirety with this Caveat; some \ninstallments are clearly R Rated and I Recommend this Saga for adults. I \nwould not recommend it for those younger than 18 years of age, and even \nadults ought to be mature intellectually and emotionally before viewing.\n\nThe Story is exceptionally well written and I may in time obtain ebooks of \nthe series.\n\nI hope others find this Review Helpful. I deliberately left out Spoilers.'
