S'This has to be one of the worst horror films i have ever seen.'
p1
aS'I already buy this movie and i love it the best horror movie ever'
p2
aS'can you help me to find out the most scary horror movie ever..'
p3
aS"It's funny how when she was cursed, she went to psychics and not a priest \nor anything. That would have been the first thing I would have done and the \nonly thing I would do. I would only ask for God's help."
p4
aS'Curse-give-it-away thing is a rip off from thinner'
p5
aS'Thats a shitty reason to put a curse on someone.'
p6
aS"freaking love this movie. It's a must-see.  "
p7
aS"Hey come on guys, ease off the hate. This was a great movie to watch on a \nnice Sunday afternoon when you don't want to think about anything too \nseriously and kill some time. There is a healthy dose of unexpectedly scary \nmoments as well as a healthy dose of unexpectedly funny moments, just \nenough creepy background music to make your skin crawl, and a nice plot \ntwist near the end. That hilarious seance scene alone made it for me. It's \na classic Sam Raimi flick that's worth a watch or two."
p8
aS'such an awful movie ever i seen in my #life -_-'
p9
aS'The envelope scene was so predictable... overall was a funny horror ! And \nthe fight from the grave made me laugh with tears. :D'
p10
aS'They should have called it "Jump Scare Me To Hell"'
p11
aS'The power of Christ compels you lol'
p12
aS'Awesome movie .'
p13
aS'The ends SUCKS '
p14
aS'So does she ever remove the curse?'
p15
aS'So she puts a curse on a woman who tried to help her, instead on the bank \npresident.'
p16
aS"Imagine the Seinfeld theme as her boyfriend shows her the envelope and \nshe's dragged to hell."
p17
aS'i just watched this movie and it was the worst horror movie ever! it was \nfake, had a bad story line and most of the scenes was so random and \nunrealistic.Waste of time really. If people think this is scary and a good \nmovie you must be a complete idiot to think that.'
p18
aS"How 'bout you pay the fucking mortgage."
p19
aS'Seriously !! It should say from the director of the evil dead!!! Not \nspiderman when you promote this movie'
p20
aS'loveddd it so much'
p21
aS"It's not so scary i love this movie!!!!!"
p22
aS'Is it just me that wonders why the woman curses her because of morgage'
p23
aS'NOT BAD HORROR BUT SHIT TRAGEDY ENDING'
p24
aS'One of the worst movies I have ever seen\n\nDisregard the trailer, this is a comedy movie, not horror.'
p25
aS'the trailer is better than the movie'
p26
aS'This Movie Looks Real Shitty'
p27
aS'I love this movie !!'
p28
aS'really love this movie ....cant seem to find it on the net ....to get the \nfull effect you would have to watch it on big screen ..gave it 8 .2 out ot \n10 phenamenol (jamaica )'
p29
aS"Seriously, if you think the movie is too funny, then you need to \nre-evaluate your horror expectations. And if you think it isn't funny... \nwell, you might just be dead inside."
p30
aS'This a comedy more than horror '
p31
aS'My favourite comedy of all time.'
p32
aS"I'm really dismayed by all the young people who think this is a bad movie. \nI think the death of VHS horror has really separated newer generations from \nthe classics and all know is Saw garbage."
p33
aS'worst fucking movie ever. horrendous acting. This is probably the guy from \naccepted\'s worst performance. The lady doesn\'t make sense most the time and \nwhen they\'re doing the ritual she admits "I\'m scared." seriously'
p34
aS'Damn i love this movie!! Great horror but i dislike the ending\nit so not fair she just doing her job and that old bitch just can pay her \nhouse damn..'
p35
aS'no nice'
p36
aS'I remember it was to scary for theaters when it was post to come out'
p37
aS'some bitch cant pay for the shit she wants. gets evicted. rather than blame \nthe government, she curses one chick that was just doing her job\n\nthat old bat is a cunt'
p38
aS'What a movie!!!! :D '
p39
aS'I love how Sam can get you stuck between laughing, scared and repulsed at \nthe same time.'
p40
aS'watched the movie....sooooo scary'
p41
aS'best comedy movie! '
p42
aS'Now when I saw this for the first time, I must say it was very creepy and \ndisturbing but the movie was really bad.'
p43
aS'Should have just gave the old women an extension...'
p44
aS'Not scary but I really like this movie.'
p45
aS'Why did she go to hell? She repented for what she did. STUPID MOVIE !!!!!'
p46
aS'No se puede ver'
p47
aS'Sam raimi does it again'
p48
aS'Lol i like the ending when her boyfriend shows the coin. Good movie pretty \nscary, ( good jumpscares ) \n\n'
p49
aS'im only ten and i think this movie is rubbish'
p50
aS'Ughh... fuck this movie, I can\'t believe the amount of praise this crap \ngot. It\'s pretty much just "Jump Scare: The Movie!"\nTerrible acting, shitty scares, no real horror atmosphere and just plain \nawkward scenes meant to be for comedic value, which just end up being a \nchore to sit through.'
p51
aS'[[[[[[[[[SPOILER]]]]]]]] Shit! I wanted the almost gonna be happy ending ..'
p52
aS'SCAREST FNG MOVIE JESUS!'
p53
aS'how is this movie rated pg13'
p54
aS'Terrible movie!'
p55
aS"I'm a horror fan, but somehow I overlooked this movie, until I watched it a \ncouple nights ago. It was surprisingly good. It's not particularly scary, \nbut has great elements of mysticism; gypsies, fortune telling, curses, \ndemons all wrapped in a straightforward plot.  I don't think most people \nwould mind watching this movie twice.  It's among the most notable horror \nmovies of the past few years. "
p56
aS'Watched this yesterday good movie'
p57
aS'FKN lame, '
p58
aS'Pretty scary movie and it is entertaining to watch so go ahead and watch it \nat night.'
p59
aS'WSHH baby'
p60
aS'This old lady was the ugliest gypsy which I ever saw on television'
p61
aS'This is one of my favorite comedy movies.'
p62
aS'This young woman in the film go through all of these changes to prevent \nherself from going to Hell, while missing the solution all along. Of \ncourse, if the main character would have tried Jesus Christ instead all of \nthe occultist mumbo-jumbo, the movie would have been over in 20 \nminutes.and 20 minute movies dont make good box office!'
p63
aS'dont let the trailer fool you the movie is shit'
p64
aS'This is one of the best horror movies ever! The production design is \nfantastic, especially that gorgeous looking room where the sance takes \nplace. The intelligent storyline actually makes sense, compared to the crap \nyou usually find in horror movies nowadays. I love that line in the movie " \nI beg you and you shame me." Sam Raimi makes the best horror films!'
p65
aS'stoooopid'
p66
aS'I love this movie :D'
p67
aS'shit'
p68
aS"There needs to be a sequel about Clay going insane by Christine being \ndragged to hell, and he races to find a way to bring her back to save her \nfrom her fate. Maybe since it's a Sam Rami movie, it could crossover with \nArmy Of Darkness, and see Clay teaming up with Ash Williams to save \nChristine from Hell."
p69
aS'nice movie.. Can anyone tell me when Can I download this video in full \nmovie'

p80
aS"That's fucking scary LOL"
p81
aS"I think it's a great movie but if she managed to mix up the envelope I'm \nsure she deserves whatever is coming for her"
p82
aS'Lol. So many dislikes on this great movie. WTF. Lots of people are too \nseriously, and cant see the fun of black humour in this movie...'
p83
aS'The scariest part of this movie was the old lady.'
p84
aS'Came here just to say this movie is shit. Lmao.'
p85
aS'"You tricked me!"'
p86
aS'torrentz.eu '
p87
aS"It's stupid: The old lady has enough power to curse someone, but not to \nsolve her own economical problems."
p88
aS'I used to be scared to death of this movie. '
p89
aS'That would suck if it happend in real life'
p90
aS"When i watch this movie, i can't help but think how Ellen Page would have \ndone the lead role instead of Alison Lohman."
p91
aS'This movie was good from beginning to end, this was a unique horror film \none that other horror movies can take notes from.'
