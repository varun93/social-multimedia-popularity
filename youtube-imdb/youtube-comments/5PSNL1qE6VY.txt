Well Unobtanium happens to sell for 20 million a kilo and they \nhave it all. Yay. Go Humans!'

p26
aS"Look people, you can deny for all you want, but the facts don't lie. Over \n2.7 BILLIONS made at the box office means a great load of people loved the \nmovie! I'm sorry it didn't have that ''Avatar'' feeling on you, but I've \nexperienced it and it was amazing! I didn't have any expectations \nwhatsoever and I think it paid a lot.\n\nThe plot is not that complicated, but the detailed world and the dynamic of \nthe movie was incredible. Not once did I noticed the computer generated \nanimations that were the Navi's, maybe because I suspended my disbelief for \nthree hours.\n\nI really don't understand some critics saying the story lacked complexity \nwhile critics are covering with gold the ''Gravity'' movie which has less \nstory developpment. It's like a hero, some people like to bring him down. \n''Avatar'' was exceptionnal, period."

Dubya and Cheney left the political scene with \ntheir hotly opposed wars and subsequent major economic collapse, this movie \nmakes a nice response to the obscene orgy of war violence aka The War On \nTerror and it's darkness that gripped the world's attention for the better \npart of the 2000s..."
