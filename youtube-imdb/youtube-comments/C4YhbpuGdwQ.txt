p38
aS'Your first point is completely invalid. The Muppet movies are always \nindependent from one another. Example: In "The Great Muppet Caper", Kermit \nand Fozzie Bear play as identical twin brothers. That movie was followed by \n"The Muppets Take Manhattan\'\', where the characters have just graduated \nfrom college. They are all standalone films that are very loosely connected.'

aS'i love this movie... just like the majority of everyone else.'
p40
aS'sambucca dont be redicilous man! the only bad thing is that idiotic Jason \nSegal and Amy Adams.Totaly bad choice of human actors.

aS"@GreatScottPilgrimage I reckon Jason Segal is what happened. He co-wrote \nthe script. Clearly he was the wrong man for the job. What's strange is \nthat it actually picks up in the last 20 minutes and feels more familiar, \nonce the telethon show begins and the traditional character-based gags are \nrolled out (the barber shop quartet was pretty funny). It almost felt like \ntwo different scripts, like the movie couldn't decide what it wanted to be."

p88
aS"It seems like most comedies these days has to have crude humor or swearing \nin it. What I like about the Muppets is that gives us a comedy that both \nkids and adults can enjoy equally. I admit that there are few references \nthat are more geared towards the older generation but in no way is it \ncrude. In fact I'd say wholesomeness of it is part of what gives the \nMuppets their charm."
