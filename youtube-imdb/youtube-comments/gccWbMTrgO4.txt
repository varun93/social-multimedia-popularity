aS'in my opinion, all 3 snow white movies are garbage .. snow white in this \nmovie is effin ugly and she almost has a unibrow !! now how could the queen \nbe jealous with that ?? snow white is definitely NOT the fairest of them \nall in this movie .. and niether is kristen stewart in "snow white and the \nhuntsman" cus for me she is just sooooo ugly .. and the snow white in the \n"grimm\'s snow white" is blonde !! i have to say the casting is really very \nweak !'
