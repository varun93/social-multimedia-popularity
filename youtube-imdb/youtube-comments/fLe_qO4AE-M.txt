aS'wanna know something funny?\n\nthe plot this movie is based on is a japanese light novel that was \nconverted into a japanese manga (comic books in japan).\nhere are some interesting details (all according to the opriginal japanese \nplot):\n- the aliens that humanity is fighting in the movie-verse are called mimics \n- they are about 3 meters in diameter, shaped like large dark-black orbs, \ncovered in spikes and attack using a particle beam fired from a large mouth \ncovered with jagged teeth.\n- rita vrataski (e. blunt) is 14 years old.\n- T. cruise\'s character is originally called "Kiriya Keiji", and is about \n15-18 years old.\n- (this is really random but still) the helmets in the original series \ncover the entire face, rather than just the eyes ( IMHO, more effective on \nthe battlefield as smoke and splattering blood are less likely to disable \nyou before the enemiy does)\n\nall in all, i liked the comics, so i\'m kind of expectant towards the movie \n- ltets jsut hope the plot wa not butchered the same way it gets butchered \nevery time a book/comics gets converted into a live action movie.\n\n\nalso bet you 100$ that by the airing of this movie, there will be over 9000 \n"emily blunt is hot" comments on this video.'

p62
aS"this version of the story sucked for one reason. the manga was pretty \nbrutal and it showed that with time the main character just got used to \neveryting the only thing that helped him keep his sanity was writting down \nthe number of the time line he was in and in the end he found rita a new \nreason to live for. he started fighting to protect her and found he's \nemotions again just to lose her in the end when she sacrifices her self to \nsave him from the loop"
p63
aS'On your feet,Maggot !!'
p64
aS"People always try to be EDGY(NO PUN INTENDED) with blanket statements about \nit should've gone that way.....ect. Nothing wrong with anything with Edge \nof Tomorrow.....guys failed these type of movies by choosing Transformers \nover this or whatever else....\n\nBEST MOVIE 2014 IN MY OPINION!!\n\nI understand the third act, and it did feel cliched, but it's either live \nor die; good wins or evil wins or open ended ending. GREAT MOVIE.\n\nThis was a movie starring Tom Cruise who is a great actor and does \nwonderful action movies. The Edge is about time travel and good vs evil and \nman vs himself all in one.\n\nThis movie was fantastic. I will not spoil anything, there are 500 other \nreviews for that. This was what guys should watch not(insert Tyler Perry \nmovie here/Twilight/Transformers).\n\nThis movie doing poor in theaters, same with Pacific Rim, signals the end \nof guy movies and Sci-Fi. The new male audience is less intelligent...I \ncall them the Apple crowd.\n\nThis IS A MUST WATCH!!!!\n\nExcellent performances, top notch camera work and great sci-fi/action \nflick. Guys need to be men again. Sad movies are not made for men any more. \nWith the failure of Pacific Rim, A-Team, Edge of Tomorrow, I think we have \nmore Twilights and Tyler Perry movies on the horizon."
