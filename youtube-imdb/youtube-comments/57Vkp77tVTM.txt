aS'Since digital has taken over film we can expect to see a lot more movies \nthat are 90% CGI and 10% a real story. This is exactly what Keanu Reeves \ntalked about in his doc "Side by Side". Digital took over film like a storm \nbut since any shmoe can make a movie now it\'s going to destroy Hollywood \nand good film making.'
p9
aS'Watched it yesterday and i can say that this movie is so bad and forced \nthat is good to laugh lol'
p10
aS'I just finished this, the acting was excellent, special effects were spot \non, and a total jaw dropper from the point of 5 or 6 funnels onward to a \nmajor twister nearly sucking people from a sewer. Wanna see what the inside \nof a twister looks like, just watch, this was definitely worth the time.'
p11
aS"Why do most Hollywood tornado movies have scary tornados being really \nskinny ones? Irl those aren't even as dangerous, and they don't even twist \naround in a weird shape that fast. Don't even get me started on how often \nmovies have dozens of them at the same time. I know it's not a realistic \nmovie, but come on it's so overused."

aS"Just finished watching it online and I have to say it was a great movie. \nLike how intense it was and how they put a little comedy in it with the two \ncrazy guys . The very ending made me laugh won't say what it is but will \nsay the vending I couldn't believe Lol. If you haven't seen it you will \nknow what I'm talking about. "

p32
aS"Aside from the plot. I was expecting some mediocre and even prepared myself \nfor a terrible movie. But hey, it wasn't as bad as I thought, the acting \nwas quite ok and believable, the fx was actually quite decent for a non \nmajor budget title. Worth watching if you're planning to..."

aS"I don't understand why so many people hate this movie, it was amazing, well \nedited, good acting, good plot, what more could you want?"
p64
aS"I love twister and this movie is very good. It doesn't have the character \ninteraction of twister but it's a lot more action packed. Parts of it are \nlike paranormal activity where the camera is free held by the actors and is \nwobbly but it adds some cool effects during the tornado attacks. I would \nrecommend it if you just want to see tornados destroy shit but if you're \nlooking for a good story stay clear. 8/10 "
