If you haven\'t seen any movies from \nthe "Cars" series, then this movie will be very enjoyable to you, but come \non... WHO HASN\'T SEEN at least ONE "Cars" movie?! So for the rest of the \nworld this is only a very color full animated movie whereas for the story \nline..... "believe in your self and you can accomplish anything" which also \nbrings up a very typical and predicable ending... Jeees Pixar stop punching \nan already dead horse! "Cars" was awesome, "Cars 2" well almost as good, \n"Planes" what again? What\'s next? "Planes 2", "Cars 3", "Boats"?'

p59
aS'Yeah they should make a Trains movie. With an old train from like the 19th \ncentury. like Doc from cars 1 movie, giving advice to the young next \ngeneration trains.'
p60
aS'i think there next movie is gunna be "Boats"'
p61

p65
aS'This movie is for kids. The idiotic haters are pathetic and can suck a big \nfat Congo cock. Dumb-asses'
p66
aS'Good movie but what pisses me of is i expected a different ending to the \nstory\nbut no, from the start of the movie you already knew the ending he fucking \nwins the race its in the cover of the movie case'
p67
aS'marketing again ..'
p68
aS'I found this movie to be just as OK as "Cars" Was.'
p69
aS'awesome trailer and what about Thomas it would totally be awesome if they \ndecided to make a boats and I think that they need to  also make a cars 3 \nand the bad guys from the first one come and take there revenge because \nthere the bad guys of course and the bad   guys never learn  there lesson '
p70
aS'I and my two friends r going to watch this this saturday coming in redhill \nciema:-D'
p71
aS'This movie would have been better if two of those planes crashed into the \nWorld Trade Center.'
p72
aS'I love disney movies just because movies like cars and planes teach such \nnice things like believing in yourself and not giving up because every once \nin a while we need to hear it too. So stop hating. '
p73
aS'I meant ships'
p74
aS'Other preview was waaaaaaaay better with the White Zombie music '
p75
aS"Wow...this was really good.  Haven't seen it yet but plan to.  I loved \nCars; this has to be good.  The music was nicely fitting also."
p76
aS'i liked this but nothing will beat jj the jet plane'
p77
aS"whats next? Trains? Trucks? Rockets? Bikes? and all those other \ntransportation shit? why not think of something else! Like Frozen 2 having \nElsa find out that there is a another person who was born with the same \npower, but that person is evil and doesn't know what love is, and while \ntrying to rule Arrendel Elsa and the evil person meet, and when he/she \ntries to get to her so he/she can rule it he/she finds the meaning of love \ninstead of evil."
p78
aS'Also i think they really should make a "tractors"'
p79
aS'the trailer is as good as the movie was terrible.'
p80
aS'i knew this from 2011'
p81
aS'i like it cause of the song'
p82
aS'Wish to know how I have seen this movie already? After seeing the trailer I \nstopped to locate it on the web and found this site where one can see all \nkinds of movies for free. I needed to come back to share the web site with \neverybody else who likes this movie trailer. Here is the website... *WatchTheseNow. \n*'
p83
aS'Magnificent. That is my take on the movie. Even more awesome was knowing \nhow to very easily view the movie absolutely free online. I was surfing the \nInternet the other day and found this place to safely view many of the \nrecent movies - for free! Look into the link and say thanks to me later *WatchTheseNow. \n*'
p84
aS'Watch Planes'
p85
aS'Can\'t wait for "Spaceships"!!'
p86
aS'This was an awesome movie. PFFT. Haters. '
p87
aS'you know what i think i think they need to make a mivie with cars, boats \n,trains, AND planes ... i bet it would be awesome!!!  '
p88
aS'Cars 3d planes 3d what else!?!?!?!?!? Dildos 3d'
p89
aS'Next will be boats and trains and snails and tables and tv and couch. '
p90
aS"This was a pathetic attempt at a movie, giving a Pixar concept (and one of \nthe ones I am less fond of) to another studio is silly. \nIt had too many characters, a cliched and predictable plot, very little \ncharacter development from any of the characters, cheesy dialogue, and a \npremise that I am personally sick of to no extent. It's basically \nfanservice to the audience that Cars has attracted. I'm just glad that \nDisney has at least left the milking of the Cars franchise to another \nstudio instead of having Pixar waste their time on it."
p91
aS'And now they\'ve announced "Cars 3".\n\nWHY PIXAR. JUST WHY.'
