aS"I'm hoping jayden finds something he's good at, because I've seen \nkindergarten plays with better acting abilities."
p4
aS"I know Jaden is a wooden actor, but making him win a Razzie when he's still \na kid, isn't that a little over the fence?? \nI mean come on, he was only 15, and just because he's in his \npuberty doesn't make him old enough to receive such rude award!\nHe just needs a little more practice on his acting, all right?"

aS"Will Smith is one of my favorite actors, just read up on the plot that \nseemed extremely interesting of this movie as well as the reviews. When it \ncomes to the Father and Son controversy, its sad that this day in age that \nsome colored minded people could' nt see the connection or talent between \nthese two due to the color of their skin. \n\nI'm of Will Smith for being able to take his on own ideas and bring them to \nlife on the silver skin. Plenty of families have started on movies together \nwhich flopped such as The Bridges, Martins, Stillers....ect Not a one \nperson focused on that. Looking forward to seeing this movie now and \nwishing the Smiths many more movies together."
p7
aS'I am boycotting this shameless movie that was created to boost his \nprivalaged, spoiled rich kids career.\n\nIts called NEPOTISM, when someone in power uses their influence to benefit \ntheir family.\n\nCharity is for the poor and those in need, i refuse to spend a cent of my \nmoney to contribute to will smiths attempts to give his already privalaged \nson more fame and fortune. I refuse to be used as a tool to give to the \nrich and undeserving.'
p8
aS'I just watched this movie and thought it was good. I heard through the \n"grape vine" that this movie was terrible, just like they said about Green \nLantern and Lone Ranger - both of which I loved. Looks like them grapes \nwere sour. It\'s a shame because it puts people off seeing great movies. \nI think some people can\'t handle the run time, identify with the subtext or \ncharacters out of their demographic and are then venomously bitter and \nviolent towards a thing - even to the point of telling other people how to \nfeel about it - consciously trying to derail the hard work of hundreds of \npeople from achieving any success or prestige.\nI don\'t give those people much time anymore - or they could stop me from \nenjoying my life and taking an interest in new things'
p9
aS'Whoever put together this epic trailer from such a shit movie deserves an \nOscar.'
p10
aS"I watched this film expecting to be terrible given the bad reviews it got. \nWhen I actually watched the film it wasn't bad at all. I wondered why \npeople were saying a decent film was very bad. It just shows the kinda \ntrolling society we live in when people claim okay movies are terrible \nbecause they don't like Will Smith hiring his son. I think people were \nexpecting dumbed down independence day action movie, when it is really a \nfamily drama that happens to be set in the future.   "
p11
aS"Awesome trailer. Great concept. The main actors are talented - and \neverything went down because of bad directing. The director M. Night had \nreceived many negative votes for most of his movies including the 'Last \nAir-bender' movie and this, After Earth. \n\nSo, dear Mr. M Night - you should shift onto some other field not \nfilmography. No offence, but just NO!\n\nBy the way, stop hating Jaden - he's got the talent and stuff - it's just \nbad directing in this case. And, not to mention that Jaden is going too off \nhis limits..."
p12
aS'Am i the only person here who actually loved this movie? I watched them \nlike twice. This movie is something i wanna recommed you all.'
p13
aS'there are so many things wrong with this movie, but lets just take the \ntrailer. how can something evolve to kill humans if humans dont leve on \nearth anymore? just a logic'

p21
aS"I won't watch this movie just because of Jaden. I wish they would have \nfound someone better because the story seems solid."
p22
aS"This is a great movie. I've watched films all my life, have read and seen \nclassic science fiction and own a classic movie collection. The incompetent \ncritics and whiny fans really blew this one. I bought this recently, as the \nreviews kept me away when it came out.\n\n It's actually an excellently acted coming of age film with well presented \nenvironmental statements and a really important statement about handling \nfear. I would give it four stars. Never trust movie critics; they have no \nqualifications for their non-professional job, and are merely pretentious \nwanna be's with an opinion, nothing more. I will post this on similar \nsites."
p23
aS'Overheard this great line in the movie, After Earth, starring Will Smith, \nand I think its truly worth sharing/spreading :\n\n"Fear is not real. The only place that fear can exist is in our thoughts of \nthe future. It is a product of our imagination, causing us to fear things \nthat do not at present and may not ever exist. That is near insanity. Do \nnot misunderstand me danger is very real but fear is a choice.'
p24
aS"I'm actually not a sci-fi typa gal, but this one I really enjoyed. The \nmovie has not a lot of action or violence, but instead it's more \nfamily-drama alike. For my taste PERFECT. I love Will Smith. He always \ngives his best. "

p36
aS'so they make cool trailers but this movie was the worst ive seen but the \nconcept is pretty good'
p37
aS'i think its the acting that put a lot of people off (will smiths son)\nit felt awkward, hes acting was not fluet and kinda ruined the flow of the \nfilm for me..\nand why is this 12 year old boy training in like a class of 20 year olds, \nit just destroys the realism..'
p38
aS"I would've been pissed if i'd paid money to see this garbage. What a \ncomplete pile of shit. Dear Will Smith, stop trying to make Jaden happen, \nIT'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN!"

p43
aS'I think this had an interesting storyline but it was really badly \nmade....the acting was terrible, the visual effects looked like they were \nthrown together, and it was just...bleah. '
p44
aS'Fakka you Jonhson'
p45
aS"I thought the intro was good but then after the crash, it seemed to be all \nfiller shots, it kinda went with its title but also it didn't, but I love \nwill smith as an actor and his son did a good ob in my opinion in karate \nkid, not as good as original but still liked it, and the movie was ok. I \nexpected more to it. Was kinda the reason I was disappointed "

aS'AFter Earth'
p54
aS'trailer is quite good but the movie itself is trash'
p55
aS'this was an amazing movie. '
p56
aS"*SPOILERS* I think the ending would have been way better if Will's son had \ngot basically the same ability to not be phased by the monsters. However, \nit would have been better after he remembered his Sister's death by the \nhand the monster, and instead of losing the fear of it, he gained so much \nhatred for the monster that he become invisible to the monster. That would \nhave been so much better. I don't know but i think hatred is very powerful, \nand if he gained the ability through hate towards the monster it would have \nmade the story much better."
p57
aS"Please don't watch this movie it's really that bad!"

p81
aS"I loved this movie! It has such an interesting plot, i must admit, it could \nhave went into bigger obstacles and went onto more challenging ones, also, \ni have hoped that Jaden in that character would have not been so afraid, \nbut it's satisfying to see him grow until the end when he faced that \nmonster. Either way! I loved the last airbender too!! I don't know why you \ndo not like it, but i do lol. definitely will watch again :)"

p89
aS'Some stuff I didn\'t know until just now, thought I\'d share:\n\n"Will Smith personally hired M. Night Shyamalan to direct. Smith had wanted \nto work with Shyamalan for several years, but couldn\'t find a suitable \nproject. Although not credited on the finished film, co-writer/producer \nWill Smith was responsible for much of the movie\'s direction. While M. \nNight Shyamalan was primarily in charge of the blocking (composition of \nshots, placement of the camera) and the visual aspects of the film (color \nand design), Will Smith who personally coached Jaden Smith in his \nperformance and dictated the development of the story and the on-screen \naction."'
p90
aS'I wanted to see this movie because Will Smith was in it, then I said no \nbecause it was directed by m night shyamalan.I when my mom got it for me on \nDVD I said took it back straight away.I could have done a better job than \nJaden did and I hate m night shyamalan for doing this to one of my most \nfavorite actors.'
p91
aS'Watching this in 2014'
p92
aS"i hate the entitlement theme is this movie, the young smith isn't credible, \nvery corny acting \n\nand why did the condor saved him then died? it's not as if the boy saved \nany of the chicks, that was stupid, and also the leopard attacked the nest \njust as he was in it, another coincidence? or is he jinxed?
