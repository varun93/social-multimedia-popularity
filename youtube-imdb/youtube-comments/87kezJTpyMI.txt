aS'Great luck and all my best to the real survivors (about whom this movie\'s \nabout) but it was not that easy to escape from most of the GULAG\'s in the \nUSSR.\n\nAnd yet. I\'m Latvian who has visited Russia. Actually I have even been in \nIrkustk, near to lake Baikal mentioned in this movie. \nThe Russian people... I haven\'t seen more kind, more great people than the \nreal Russians. Not in Scandinavia, not in France, not in The UK (though \nhaven\'t been to the USA).\nAbout USSR... can you say "No" (to kill in innocent and serve the MF Stalin \n(hope he\'s still in much pain in the hell)) IF lives of your family and \nrelatives are at stake???\nI can not.\nAnd that\'s the story of the great "loyal" warriors for the USSR... and even \nfor the Nazi Germany'

See how easy that was?'
