p43
aS'@shadeslayer117 No.'
p44
aS'When I first saw John Preest in the trailer I was like: "Why the hell is \nJason Voorhees in the movie"?!'
p45
aS"I have no idea what just went on in that trailer? Let's hope the movie has \na better narrative."
p46

p57
aS'@Vexlulz I believe this calls for a response ;-) Now why am I such a twat? \nMy my, I guess having your first "high-rate" comment calls upon many \nadmirers and haters. But oh well, bring it on... I look forward to your \ncorrespondance >:)'

aS'Who knows how the trailer melody name is?'

p62
aS'@ilovepanslabyrinth Well, first I\'m actually quite happy to have my first \n"high-rate" comment :D Well the character\'s name is Franklin, assuming it\'s \nhis first name, but may I suggest don\'t compare yourself to this guy too \nmuch :-D Really, it\'s awesome to find some parallels, but knowing the \ntragedy of this movie I suggest you don\'t. But enjoy the movie, I believe \nthey still have it in Blockbuster to rent. '
p63
aS'I love the ending, especially the scene of suicidal girl and the \nheartbroken man. It made me remember something.'
p64
aS'what an interesting looking movie... perhaps sumthin i been dying to watch \nin a verrry long time :o'
p65
aS'I wish the whole movie was set in Meanwhile City, although the \ndual-reality/delusion suffered by Preest/David was clever. The end of the \nmovie implied that Meanwhile City was real, e.g., Amelia catching a glimpse \nof Preest before the explosion and the City rising up in the background, \nghostlike, behind the remaining characters at the end of the film like some \nkind of a kind of coincident although separate reality - and one I would \nhave like to have seen much more of. Extraordinary.'
p66
aS'WATCHMEN and DARK CITY come to mind?'
p67
aS'@UniversalVision Yes?'
p68
aS'Ok then, how would you do it differently?'
p69
aS'the music at the end of the trailer, wasnt that the same they used later in \nkick-ass?'
p70

p85
aS'@UniversalVision Man what the hell. I don\'t think this movies gonna bother \nany optimists, religious people or "faint of heart" so obviously i didn\'t \nwatch the movie properly? For the record i watched this with a person who \nis both opitimistic and heavily religious; he didn\'t die or go into shock \nor anything, it\'s a really normal movie and there\'s a lot worse out there. '
p86
aS"A movie you can't miss for one other reason... it's apsoludely visualy \nstunning! If you look at it from technical side it's a masterpiece of how \nto use shadow and light, how to make a great scene with minimal ammount of \nspecial effects and make everyscene soak with details, yet be very clear \nfor the viewer. Insanely well made!"
p87
aS"If somebody knows, what's the name of this song... please tell me."
p88
aS'@Tribefull yeah well maybe ill see it, the problem is see with this film is \nits like seeing Dark City and The Watchmen fused together, so what is this \nfilm going to show me new?....'
p89
aS'@shadeslayer117 dont knock this movie till you have seen it. its REALLY \ngood.'
p90
aS'I love this movie, and trailer is awsome, but the trailer seems to sugest a \ncompleatly diferint story than the movie'
p91
aS"I like masked vigilante's, like rorchach or V for Vendetta. I think the \nattitude from franklyn or rorchach or V for Vendetta is kind of political \nin a way. They're both worried about the world and crime and conspiracies. \nThe masks deliver the mysterious conception."
p92
aS'@bibbybou That is how you spell psychology and dont hate on him just \nbecause you didnt like what he had to say. Lighten up.'
p93
aS'@Michaelmop The ending scene was how the stories connected, when David \naccidently shoots the boy (Milo) instead of his father when in the suicidal \ngirl (Emilia)s apartment. Milo was left at the alter by his fianc, and so \nhe imagined seeing his "Childhood sweatheart" to help deal with the stress. \nShe ended up looking like Emilia, and started following her around, because \nshe thought it was her. SHE hated her mother (Raped by her father?)and \n"committed suicide" every month to spite her mother. '
p94
aS"I just wish that they would stop make a movie that confuse the audiences. \nThis movie is great but to made us though that JP 's City really exist and \nreveal the truth that it was just a madman's delusion in the end is somehow \na killjoy"
p95
aS"I'm next to watch The Fall, is from Tarsem. Seem to be a great visual \nexperience too, although I'm not sure if it's a fantastic plot like \nFranklyn."
