S'You hit like a vegetarian!'
p1
aS'Thank god I watched the movie before I saw this trailer. Wow they spoiled \neverything.....'
p2
aS"This movie had everyone man. Sly, Arnie, Holly from The Office, Fiddy, \nVincent D'Onofrio, the guy from Jurassic Park, the guy from Iron Man, the \nfootballer, heck even Jesus is in it."
p3
aS'The trailer spoiled the movie. :/'
p4
aS'Stupid trailer, revealing the whole plot.'
p5
aS'Great movie 8/10 '
p6
aS'Is that Rambo?'
p7
aS'prison break much?'
p8
aS'Is this a good movie?Just asking,cuz a few friends recommended this movie \nto me but i still wanna know your opinion :)'
p9
aS'this movie is freaking good'
p10
aS'I watched it cinpletely unprepared. Great surprising appearence of Arnie \nsomewhere at minute 25 or so. Very nice, great cast. Amazing what the two \noldies still do.'
p11
aS'big shit ever see'
p12
aS'Nice Trailer, I was watching two times so far'
p13
aS'Jesus the trailer shows the whole movie :/'
p14
aS'"Fitty"always has a complex that he is not smart enopugh(wonder why)so  in \nmost of the movies he play the sensivitve  bitch.We all got it "Fitty":you \nare a smart and sensitive rapper(i think Mad tv also observed it :watch MAD \nTV - Sad 50 Cent)'
p15
aS'had to stop in the middle of the trailer before i feel like i watched the \nmovie already...'
p16
aS"All done for the day; now it's movie time :)\n\nhttp://youtu.be/CI4EjV_x_PQ"
p17
aS'One of the best films ever!!'
p18
aS'50 cent'
p19
aS'That was badass'
p20
aS'Damn, this trailer shows waaay too much. I just got a summary of the whole \nfilm in 2,5 minutes! I just wanted to see a sneak peak, not the whole movie \nsummed up.'
p21
aS'I just had to watch this to confirm how much it spoils. Ive just watched \nthe movie. Ive personally tried really hard to stray away from watching \nmovie trailers, no matter what. I now just prefer watching movies just \nbarely checking imdb scores, going by titles, 1 line descriptions and the \nlist of the actors.\n\nI prefer to know as little as possible about the movies i watch so when i \nfinally take time to watch a movie i want everything to be new.'
p22
aS'This movie was cool, and Breslin was bad ass!'
p23
aS'That....looked....AWSUM'
p24
aS'waiting for terminator 5......'
p25
aS'This movie was just...lol. Basicly, so this guy goes to jails and checks \nthem to see if they actually work. So to do this, he kills people when they \nare JUST doing their job? I found it really hard to see who was the good \nguy here, the people doing their job and keeping prisoners in jail, or the \nprisoners breaking out?\nThe ending of the movie was even more halarious. He explodes the whole \nprison, killing all innocent people who where just doing their jobs to keep \nbad people in jail. So really hes just saying " Sorry mother fuckers, your \nprison didnt fit up to standards, so all of you die."'
p26
aS'I like how the title says "Schwarzenegger" instead of the actual main \ncharacter of the movie, Sylvester Stallone. The better of the two 80\'s \naction movie stars. '
p27
aS"I am happy I didn't watch the trailer before the movie, such a spoil"
p28
aS'ah the guy from person of interest! i cant see him as the bad guy with a \nhigh pitch voice :('
p29
aS"Iv'e seen a lot of movies lately, and this movie just plain stands out.  \nExcept for some somewhat unnecessary portions and cinematic music toward \nthe end of the movie when it hit the fan and pandemonium broke out, this \nmovie was absolutely awesome.  50 Cent should've had more roles and a song \nin the movie-- my opinion-- but almost everything else was great.  Stallone \nis a great actor in the right movies, and Arnold with him in this movie was \nalmost an unbeatable pairing.  The names for Arnold (Rottmayer and Manheim) \nwere also just brilliant.  Great writing and producing overall. I was so \nimpressed that I actually paused and read through the credits and all the \nnames of the people involved in the production of this film at the end; I \ndidn't even do that for Valkyrie (or any other movie), my current favorite \nmovie.  This movie makes me want to write and produce.  Again, only at the \nend of the movie did any unnecessariness creep in (and some cheesiness) \nthat I wish had been edited out or/and done better; but besides all that, \nthis movie kicked butt from here to Timbuktu (or Morocco).  See it."
p30
