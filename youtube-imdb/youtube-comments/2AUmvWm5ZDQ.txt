S'It\'s the standard 90s action movie. It looks okay but they\'re not going to \nsell a movie called "John Wick." That\'s what happened with "John Carter". \nGive the movie a catchy title like "Machine Gun Romance" or something. \nPerhaps make the character more interesting instead of the standard good \nguy. Some character depth! How about he\'s a drug-addicted ex-wrestler with \nroid range. Just SOME original thought, PLEASE. '
p1
aS'... okay... I love the dumb yet hilarious and oddly original motive for \nrevenge. Almost EVERY revenge movie ever made is because of the murder of \nwife, daughter, son, or all of the above, to a point where its so formulaic \nand cliche that its common place... That is however a motive for a \nsemi-regular person to go on a revenge quest, John Wick is clearly not a \nregular person, he is a Hitman... from the looks of it a very mean Hitman.. \nand the fact that he goes on this unending revenge quest because of \nsomething so comparatively menial like killing his dog and taking his car \nmakes this fucking brilliant. I want to see this, now.'
p2
aS'KEANU REEVES IS ONE OF THE MOST UNDERRATED OF ALL TIME!. EVER!.'
p3
aS"Go see *John Wick*. If you like hard-boiled action, then this is a gun fu, \ncar fu, 3rd person shooter for you. The first act is mopey Keanu, but as \nsoon as John Leguizamo makes that phone call the movie kicks into high \ngear. It's fun and fast and it has a sense of humor about itself, plus it \ninvents a wonderful shadow world of hitmen and mob slang. I really enjoyed \nthe movie."
p4
aS'this movie was bad the fuck ass!! he was whoopin ass the whole movie! for \nthe most part it was cohessive story line, some things you could nitppick. \nvillins where mean n badass, but the boogeyman was after em, 8.5/10 keanu \nalways delivers in my book.very underrated actor, i think maybe cause he \njust does what he wants to do instead of doing movies with the same clique \nof ppl if u dnt agree mabe just stick to watching fucking transformers and \nhunger faggot games. go see john wick!!..stab scene in the begining was \ngnar gnar =P'
p5
aS'"Going on a killing spree just because of the dog?" Said people who never \nhad a dog in their life'
p6
aS'I am legend rip off!'
p7
aS"I'm sorry... going to war over a dog? Lol. Pass!"
p8
aS"It's nice to see Keanu back in the movies again !!"
p9
aS"so he gets pissed off cause his dog he got from his wife was killed...now \nhe's blowing shit up....yeah that's a solid movie right there."
p10
aS"For the love of God, what is with the Keanu hate? He's a fantastic, \nunderrated actor with real skill who always delivers, even in bad movies \n(Lake House, anyone?). Man of Tai Chi was over-the-top but absolutely \nfantastic, and this just looks superb. Even if the story isn't special, the \nmovie still looks like a fantastic action thriller."
p11
aS"What's the first song in the trailer? "
p12
aS"I almost run over a cat with my car last night, just imagine if it was John \nWick's cat..."
p13
aS'Theon is always making bad decisions..\nBut on a serious note I am so happy to see Keanu Reeves back and in a movie \nI actually want to see! '
p14
aS"It looks like the typical over-the-top Hollywood shit. More so, that story \nline can't be any more lazy and stupid. Sure, because a mafia that has \nmillions to launder can't buy 10 of those cars anywhere else from glad \nsellers or even steal one without detection. What's next? Beating people \nover racing bicycles found on eBay?"
p15
aS'Anyone recognize Theon Greyjoy as one of the thugs?'
p16
aS'Looks like an Anti-Animal Cruelty\nfilm.'
p17
aS'Had to stop watching the trailer about a minute or so in. Giving way too \nmuch info away imo'
p18
aS'Finally an action character that can hold a gun semi-realistically, too \noften do heroes in action movies hold guns in ways that would make the \nrecoil uncontrollable or stupidly inaccurate '
p19
aS"Ian McShane is the only reason I'm seeing this movie! "
p20
aS"I'm all for a mindless action flick but going on a fucking killing spree \nafter someone kills your dog.... really? It sounds like something a 14 year \nold would come up with."
p21
aS"It's time for his Payday too"
p22
aS'Keanu is back!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Wick (2014) - Official Trailer: http://youtu.be/2AUmvWm5ZDQ'

aS'Keanu Statham did a fine job in this one, obviously killed 500 Russian \nmobsters w/ 1 shot, while all the Russian Mobsters missed 500 shots \nshooting at him.'
p24
aS"If you're wondering if this movie's any good, go watch Chris Stuckmann's \nreview of it."
p25
aS'This movie is a rip-off of The Hunger Game!'
p26
aS'Another "I can kill u will my pinky" movie....sigh...hollywood...'
p27
aS'this or fury... I cant decide...'
p28
aS'*Well this sprung-up on me outta nowhere, looking forward to it as i like \nKeanu and a simple action film :)*'
p29
aS"Remember...............DO NOT KILL JOHN WICK's DOG AND STEAL HIS FUCKING \nCAR!!!\n\nGOT IT??!!!!"
p30
aS'This looks stupid.'
p31
aS'I wannt to watch this movie and compare it to the equalizer , I wonder \nwhich one will be better ahaha '
p32
aS"Come on that was more than a dog, it was a cute amazing thing that runs \naround and makes you feel happy. Then, some jerk decides to kill it, wtf. \nI'm never going to watch that movie even though it looks action packed :/"
p33
aS'"My dog is dead, therefore, I am now a hitman!"\n\nlolz Keanu Reeves truly is The One.'
p34
aS"*In a epic movie voice*\nThey stole his car and killed his dog.\nNow he's out for revenge!\nKeanu Reeves is John Wick in the new action packed movie...\nJohn Wick.\nIn cinemas soon."
p35
aS"Damn, they Micheal Vick that dog lol ....... (just a little humor don't get \nmad)"
p36
aS"I always root for reeves to have a successful and awesome movie, because \nhe's a likable fellow, but since the matrix series i haven't enjoyed very \nmany of his films. This doesn't get me very hyped either. Could end up \nbeing suprised though, who knows. But he should take on some more dynamic \nroles than these anti-hero protagonists he always seems to play. Maybe get \ninto a drama or a comedy, shit, even a romantic comedy for all i care. Just \nsomething else to break up the monotony. "
p37
aS'This is like the cheesiest concept ever. He kills all these people over his \npuppy. Puppies are awesome but I swear this is some kind of parody.'

p44
aS"They killed his dog and stole his car now he's out to destroy their entire \ncriminal organization "
p45
aS'a big reason I want to watch this is to see that sniveling punk Theon get \nhis '
p46
aS"I really want to watch this movie...the only thing I concern is the scene \nwhen the puppy is killed. Is it too graphic? I can't stand watching and \nanimal being killed..."
p47
aS'So a trailer that starts off as a guy with a puppy then tries to be some \nhardcore action movie?'
p48
aS"Whatever you do just don't kill other people dog. Welcome back Keanu \nReeves. :-)"
p49
aS'What you think +Scott M '
p50
aS'finally a movie about a man taking revenge for his dog and car\n\nsurprised it took this long'

aS'2:14! godzilla?'
p53
aS'am not afraid of john wick !!! ..... AHA\nwhats the name of the song on the trailer start  ?!!!'
p54
aS"What's called the song when they're shooting in the dance house??"
p55
aS"Just an fyi to anyone not interested in the film because of this trailer, \nthis trailer sucked ass. It didn't do it justice, the film was much better \nthan the trailer shows. I went into this movie not seeing a trailer, so I \nwent in with no expectations. Just give the film a chance, very good film \nwith Keanu Reeves, great action. One of the best action films I've seen in \nawhile to be honest, and one of the better films of this year."
p56
aS'what is music?'
p57
aS'Saw this movie in the theatre yesterday, so worth the watch on the big \nscreen. Great movie and good cast.'
p58
aS'what an fucking jew movie, the whole killing throughout the videos is \nbecause of a stupid fucking dead dog ! uahahha'
p59
aS'Why does this poor Theon Greyjoy guy have to be beaten up by his father and \nget his dick chopped off in every movie he plays ?'
p60
aS'This movie was so damn good!'
p61
aS"they're after his car and puppy now lol"
p62
aS"I fucking hate this trailer it doesn't tell u what the story is about if it \nhas one and the fucking ad pops up every where Fuck John wick "
p63
aS'song 1:32'
p64
aS"I'm not fear John Wick but I fear ramsey snow"
p65
aS"This movie had me grinning throughout. It doesn't try to be deep or \ncomplex, it's all about the action. The shootouts and fight scenes are \nspectacular and Keanu Reeves is at his best here. John Wick is so bad ass \nhe's like Neo and Johnny Utah put together. One of the best action flicks \nI've seen in a long time and I was never bored."
p66
aS'Yes Keanu I will go see this. '
p67
aS'Tbh Keanu Reeves is a great actor, but Jesus where do I start? First off \nhe\'s doing this all for his dog? I mean seriously? The sheer amount of \nhuman lives he takes out just in the trailer. And another thing, if he\'s \nsome Badass mofo that can do all this shit, why didn\'t he do it initially? \nAdd don\'t give me that Oh he just woke up and hasn\'t done this stuff in \nyears shit. That stuff gets imprinted in your mind when you learn it, you \nnever forget how to do that stuff. Add on the cheasy one liners, \nstereotypical assassin shit, and the same feme fatale, it\'s your average \nanti hero movie. And they just had to add in the "he was the best" line. \nSorry Hollywood, that got old 10 years ago. And another thing this actually \nseems to be a rip off of the equalizer. The only difference is denzels \nmovie actually has a real human motive for causing his carnage and \ndestruction. Not killing a thousand people for a fucking puppy. And you\'d \nthink Theon Greyjoy would get smarter and not fuck with so many dangerous \npeople. '
p68
aS'Lmfao over a dog? '
p69
aS'JUST DO COWBOY BEBOP ALREADY!!...still watching this one.'
p70
aS'For those asking what the second song in the trailer is Break Science - \nBrain Reaction ft Redman and Lettuce'
p71
aS"what's the song a 1:30??"
p72
aS'Song and artist for the SECOND song? Anyone know?'
p73
aS'he is the chosen one in the matrix so the guy that killed his dog is fucked'
p74
aS'Movie looks bass a$$'
p75
aS'Best movie trailer 10/10 keanu Reeves will get a Oscar for this movie PETA \nwill be happy mustang owners will be happy and die hard fans will be happy \nthis WILL be the die hard for the new generation \n\nBUT seriously FUCK THIS movie'
p76
aS'sold. I am soo watching this. '
p77
aS'Intro song name..?'
p78
aS'Excellent! This movie is str8 action non-stop. It keeps you entertained and \nwatching until the end. Keanu is a marvelous actor! '
p79
aS'Very good movie. I highly recommend  it.'

aS'Payday 2 sent me here'
p81
aS'Theon Greyjoy is still a dumbass.'

p83
aS'YAAAAAAAAAAA Keanu in a action-fighting movie again. I LOVE IT!'
p84
aS'Dap'
p85
aS"Just watched the movie. The acting was mediocre, cliche one liners here and \nthere... An action movie made for the sake of an action movie... I'm giving \nit a 8/10... I actually think the choreography in this movie is the best \nI've ever seen. You saw EVERYTHING. No shaky cameras and awkward camera \nviews... it was up close and as Jack Wick says, 'personal'. Overall \nhowever, the general public has hyped this up. If it was a cheesy actor \nplaying this role, it would've easily of gotten a 4/10.\n\nKeanu is 'the one' for this role."
p86
aS'If think people in Hollywood lost their sense of reality completely... I \nwould rather watch MARVEL comics , it\'s made more sense to me ,than this \nfucking "Gangsta musical super hero bull shit " and it is not because I am \nRUSSIAN ...typical Hollywood LOL '
p87
aS'Best movie .. stylish revenge.. full of action.. cold blooded killer with \nan ethic.. commitment.. all the actions are logic and acceptable.. no super \nskill or power just a ordinary guy with skillful combat action style.. full \nof coding talks.. one word Stylish.. 4.5 stars from me.. '
