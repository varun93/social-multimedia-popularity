aS'I just watched the movie after only seeing the trailer before. I expected \nit to be a war movie that was similar to Black Hawk Down, but it was \ndifferent. The action had less intensity, which made it more realistic. \nSome parts were drawing out, but they had a purpose of showing the tedious \ndetail of soldiering. It showed the suddenness of violence, and hit home \nthe sense that any moment could be your last. It was great that it did not \nshow this in a frantic way, as a team of soldiers is organised, and they \nfollow some plan to solve the problems that they face. The events and \nscenes had many mindbending points, which also were a surprize to me, which \nI could not have imagined before - it was the bizarreness or a combat zone, \nand what goes on there. It was a great movie, as it looked deep into the \npsyches of the soldiers and what goes on in their mind as things boil down \nto their essence. The screenwriter has done a great job of brining so many \nsubtle points out with this movie. I guess he was able to do this because \nhe was embedded in the war, and there he developed a keen sense of the \nreality of what it was like to be there - conveying the dangers these \nsoldiers need to face each day. Very good film. Thank you Mark Boal for \nwritting it, and bringing it to the screen.'

aS'It gave the feel for military.. swearing. Go watch Jarhead and tell me if \nthere is more in that one.'
p71
aS'You brought it to the point. I guess anyone who says that death is nothing \nto be afraid of can be declared as a liar... but sadly sometimes accepting \nlife might be harder than accepting death... for instance it depends on the \npeople you live with, what has happened in your life and what you make of \nit! Just too many factors that play a role... it would take forever to \ndebate on that! But yes, you just brought it to the point: Fear is natural'

aS'Hello, I am here to remind you that what you said is still a really really \ndumb thing! :)'
p73
aS'i agree!(just without the swearing...)'
p74
aS'I understand, I only watched it to see if it was that good as everybody \nsaid it was (after the Oscars, you know beating Avatar and stuff) and I \ndidn\'t like it at all either, honestly, it was boring as hell, I couldn\'t \nwait for it to end...the only "good part" was the sniper scene and it \nwasn\'t even that good. I\'d rather watch Black Hawk Down any day, any time. \nHell, I\'d even rather watch Avatar or Battle: LA than this....'

p88

p89
aS' I can understand different levels of accepting death...but it is natural \nfor any living creature to want to survive, thus experiencing fear on some \nlevel when in a dire situation. Be it when saving the lives of other or \njust yourself. '
