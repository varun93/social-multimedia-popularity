S'I am soo confused by the ending OMG. Can someone explain it? :o'
p1
aS'Fuck This Movie.'
p2
aS"I want to watch this movie but I'm so scaaareddddd"
p3
aS"Good movie. Keeps you on your toes. I don't understand why everyone is \nconfused by the ending though, it made perfect sense to me. I think that a \nlot of people understood... but didn't WANT to understand... kinda like \nTeddy >:}"
p4
aS'I have to thank "The Silence of the Lambs" for opening me up to the \nthriller genre. I always wanted to see this film, but was too chickens**t \nto do so. "Silence" opened up this genre to me, and now I\'ve seen this, \n"Black Swan", and I hope to see "Savages" soon. Any recommendations for a \nthriller I should watch? POST IT!'
p5
aS"I've just watched it, and I must say Leo is such an amazing actor, like on \none moment I thought it was all true, coz his acting was so realistic!!! \nAnd still no Oscar, WTF?! The movie is fascinating, especially the ending! \nVery unpredictable!"
p6
aS'With the "twist" at the end of the movie I thought I was watching a bad M \nNight Shyamalan movie.'
p7
aS"You must watch this movie, it's hands down one of the best movies I've ever \nseen."
p8
aS"Leo in a movie is the stamp of quality that you all need. Leo doesn't \nappear in shit movies. You remember me telling you this, you'll find it's \ntrue"
p9
aS'Which would be worse?\nto live as a monster or to die as a good man\n\n\n\nBrilliant movie '
p10
aS'The end of the movie is just mental..'
p11
aS'Shutter Island - La isla siniestra\n\nEn el verano de 1954, los agentes judiciales Teddy Daniels y Chuck Aule son \ndestinados a una remota isla del puerto de Boston para investigar la \ndesaparicin de una peligrosa asesina que estaba recluida en el hospital \npsiquitrico Ashecliffe, un centro penitenciario para criminales \nperturbados dirigido por el siniestro doctor John Cawley. Pronto \ndescubrirn que el centro guarda muchos secretos y que la isla esconde algo \nms peligroso que los pacientes.'
p12
aS'Outlast anyone?'
p13
aS'Spoiler Alert: Leonardo is the one that killed his wife and the mental \nhospital was looking for him. So he ends up being a patient '
p14
aS"I don't understand the ending... is he still psychopath or already \nnormal... or he was already kinda normal and became psycho again..."
p15
aS"Just got done seeing this and I have to say I loved it, it reminds me of \nthe movie the triangle. Now for everyone saying they are confused its \nbecause there is a few different ways you can interpret the ending. You can \nsay that he really was crazy and he made all of it up just to escape his \nmurdering life and there is facts to prove that, but you could say he was \nnot crazy and they were trying to manipulate him to thinking he did this \nand that and he just went along with it to play them and that's what I \nbelieve happen and there is also a lot of facts to prove that, so really \nits just whatever you believed happen or understand and the director did an \nawesome job with that.    "
p16
aS'Meh 6/10\n\nThey overdid the "twist" at the end. It was a little bit Try-hardish '
p17
aS'I get so frustrated with this ending UGHHHH There can be so many \nexplanations with the ending... So many different ideas like 1) he can \nactually have done it or 2) they could have just been getting into his head \nand making him think he did it .... Is it just me or do other people have \nthis problem as well? '
p18
aS'*Shutter Island (2010)*\nHoly. Crap. WHAT JUST HAPPENED?!? *8.7/10*'
p19
aS"I'm watching this movie right now. It's soooo scary!! IDK if I can finish \nit D:"
p20
aS'trailer done right '
p21
aS'*Shutter Island (2010)*\nHoly. Crap. WHAT JUST HAPPENED?!? *8.7/10*'
p22
aS'Great movie'
p23
aS'HELL NO. IM NOT READING THE BOOK ANYMORE. SCREW MY BOOK REPORT. '
p24
aS'How is this movie PG?'
p25
aS'I just watched this movie.This is now in Top 5 of my favorite movies.'
p26
aS"People get so upset that this movie tricked them and therefore say it's a \nbad movie or had a horrible ending bc it wasn't a happy ending. Personally \nI love movies like this. One of my favorites."
p27
aS"each and every time I watch this movie, I wonder how and why L. Dicaprio \nnever received any oscar for all his roles... He's such a brilliant actor."
p28
aS'Brilliant movie!'
p29
aS'this is a masterpiece no worries.'
p30
aS"I watched it last night and i absolutely LOVED it! One of the best movies \ni've ever seen. But i got a bit confused and i must admit i didn't \nunderstand some parts. So i will watch it again very soon :)"
p31
aS'Why Dicaprio has not won an Oscar, is beyond my comprehension. The most \ncharismatic actor of his generation, he has given an unparallel deapth to \neach and every one of his characters. Shutter Island is a masterpiece and \nDicaprio is breathtaking. '
p32
aS'one of the best movies i ve personally seen !! '
p33
aS'Outlast 2 plz red barrels'
p34
aS'One of the best movies ever! Mr. Scorsese is a living legend.'

p40
aS'This drove me crazy! '
p41
aS'Watching it for the 1st time~~~~~'
p42
aS"I loved going back and watching this movie again. You notice the little \nthings like the guards being alert at the start of the movie because they \nare afraid of him, and when the guards are searching the rocks near the \nlighthouse for the 'missing person' they are just sitting around throwing \nrocks into the ocean because they know they aren't looking for anything.\nScorsese is an amazing director and Leo and incredible actor."
p43
aS'Make it seem like a horror movie rather than psychological thriller.'
p44
aS'Really interested movie , I love it 33'
p45
aS'Can someone recommend me a Movie with Leonardo DiCaprio that makes sense?'
p46
aS"I just felt like I should let the lot of of you that is too scared to watch \nthis wonderful film that this is not actually a horror flick. It is an \naction/suspense mystery thriller and will have you on your toes for the \nwhole movie. And if you are still too scared to watch it, then I highly \nrecommend reading the novel that was released in 2004. Very great read by \nthe way. I think i might have liked it better than the movie. But that's \njust my opinion"
p47
aS'give the man his oscars!'
p48
aS'Just watched this movie...\nJust got my brain fucked...'
