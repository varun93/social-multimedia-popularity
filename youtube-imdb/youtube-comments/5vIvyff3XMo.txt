p23
aS'Seriously the girl deserved to get punched, she was hitting the guy, \npushing him and embarrassing him. if a man did that to a women, "oh ur \nbreasts are so tiny, ur a whore, i couldnt cum with ur little pussy" she \nwould slap him or hit him and everyone would cheer. Gender equality means \nboth a man and woman are  equal and what is sexual harassment with one \ngender, doesn\'t make it ok for another.'
