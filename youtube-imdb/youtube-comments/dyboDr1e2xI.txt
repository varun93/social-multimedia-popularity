p10
aS"This is a really dull and dreadful movie that's mostly one-dimensional and \nmonotonous throughout, with hardly any dramatic build-up. Such a waste of \nthe talent of its big name cast. Disappointing."
p11
aS"I'm going to watch this movie for one reason: it was produced by Leonardo \nDicaprio \n\nIs that how you spell his name? I don't know. You think I'm going to take \n20 seconds out of my life to Google it? I'm not. I'm not. \n\nWatching this trailer has also taught me something I didn't know: don't \ngamble online, it could be fixed.

p78
aS"Its called an observation. He is overacting in this trailer. He is clearly \ntrying very hard to come off intimidating which he just doesn't. Batman is \nintimidating. Unlike Heath Ledger who, at the time, was still relatively \nunknown we have seen a shit load of Ben's work. I am not saying he can't do \nit, saying I personally don't see him doing it well. Learn to read between \nthe lines kid."

aS'As I see this film very good, is it?Can anyone send me website where I can \nwatch this cool movie in decent quality, not cinema recorded? Pleaseee \nThanks '
p81
aS'Dude, if Affleck can dish out the Evil Boss shtick in this movie, I have \ntotal %100 faith he can pull off the tattered and torn Batman in the \nSuperman sequel - He\'s already got suave and secure, calm and collected \nBrucie, so all he needs is to show he can pull some punches to be Batman. \nHell, if Batman can beat Superman and nearly kill him (but chooses not to \ndue to the whole "I don\'t kill" gimmick) in the comic verse, I\'d love to \nsee him beat Henry Cavill in the movie verse.
