I dunno, I just don't like him :/ I know the whole love \nstory between Jace and Clary is like the biggest part of the books but \ntheir relationship is reminding me too much of the pathetic Twilight love \nstory; the whole way Jaces love for clary is so strong he can't live \nwithout her, Clary can't live without Jace, Jace's guilt in case he hurts \nher so he tries to stay away... the whole martyr thing, blah blah blah, \nkinda makes me boke. Clarys like what... 16? and has fallen totally in love \nwith a guy after a month while thinking he was her brother, dating someone \nelse and being involved with a war?? Please...Not believable. Don't get me \nwrong the books are good but not great. I really have only continued to \nread them because of Simon :) It's just Jaces and Clarys relationship is an \nirritating reminder of Bella/Edward when I'm reading their scenes. I'm more \nexcited when I see Simon's name mentioned and Lukes, even Magnus' and Alecs \nrelationship is more intriguing than Jaces and Clarys....They have been \nmade as the lead characters yet I find them really boring. Anyway Simon's \ncharacter, for me anyway, is definitely more real and appealing than \nJaces. "

p21
aS'\nA verse :\nTell me, ye that desire to be under the law,\ndo ye not hear the law?\nGalations 4 :21, kjv.\n\n\nThere are two ways, to be saved ("preserved") :\nBy keeping the Law of Moses, OR by not walking\nafter the flesh, as it is written : see, Romans 8:1, kjv.\n\n\nThey who are saved, have a hope of salvation :\nNot walking after the flesh, they wait to be clothed\nupon, and are for now, as a "city of bones".\nBut beware, lest you should fall short of salvation,\nas it is written, Our God is a Jealous God, even a\nconsuming fire. Ever hear of "spontaneous human\ncombustion"? You do not wish to end up as a "city of\nashes", and lose your hope of salvation. For such was \nsodom and gomorah.\n\n\nSee, Acts 28: 24-28, kjv.\n\n\nSo beware of them who tell you it is OK to do as\nyou please - for they desire you to walk after the\nflesh, and so doing, be found under the law of moses,\nas opposed to the perfect law of liberty. They who\nwalk after the spirit - minding eternal things - are under\ngrace. But again, be careful you do not "devolve",\nlest you find yourself cast out. Have you been made\nperfect in love? See, Philippians 3, kjv. Cast trials\nbehind you, as you get stronger, are made better..\n"There\'s something different about you.."\n\n\nLove is love. There are not different kinds of love,\nbut words such as grace, or charity, hint at other\nspirits closely associated with love, or refer to\naspects, or dimensions, of love, the way "white light"\ncan be broken down into about seven colours (red,\norange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet).\nGod is Love. God is a he. Charity, and Grace, are\neach a she. A mother loves a child (Maleficent\'s love for\nAurora), and a man loves his wife (Osiris\' love for Isis) :\nLove is love. And love "dictates" (commands) that one\nwho loves another, do so a certain way, and not another \nway. See, "Levitical Code". The Word of God is Truth.\nGod is Love. Truth and Love are one. See, John 10:30, kjv.\nIf you do not know what words mean, how will you know\nwhat is written? A font. A colour. How like a voice?\n\n\nSee, Romans 8:13, kjv. One gets hurt sometimes,\nand needs healing - prayer, love, "magic" : The\nparable of the ten virgins comes to mind - five\nwere foolish, and desired oil for their lamps, from\nthem who were wise... City of Bones.. versus .. City\nof Ashes.. Eh, life is very much a beauty contest,\nand inner beauty is invisible to the eyes.\n\n\nBlack. White. Bone. Earth. The First Man was created\nof the dust of the ground. The ground then was moist\neverywhere, and hence dark in appearance, for a mist\nwent up from the ground and watered the face of the\nwhole earth. And the ground then brought forth life\nabundantly - there was no death - roses did not bear\nthorns, before God cursed the ground, for man\'s sake.\nThe First Woman was created from a rib taken from\nthe man. She was "white", he was "black", and from \nthem, came us. Some look more like the first man,\nwhile others look more like the first woman. Who\nlooks "eevee", and who looks "adamee", is debateable.\n\n\n"You know, he dies his hair blonde". Goddess worship,\nhas been, since the Fall. Jacob, his skin was smooth,\nlike a girl\'s. Whereas Esau, he was hairy, and his father\nIsaac\'s favourite. But Rebekah loved Jacob, he was her\nfavourite. Are girls really more angelic than boys?\nAs some have said, Catholic Weddings are easy to\nunderstand - he\'s a pirate, and she\'s an angel. I guess\nthat would make their daughter, Pippi Longstocking, huh?\n\n\nIf you do not know what words mean, how will you\nknow what is written? Fair, means "feminine beautiful".\nTechnically, a boy does not desire to be confused for a\ngirl, nor does a girl desire to be confused for a boy -\nusually. Goliath, when he looked upon David, he saw a \n"fair countenance", and this disturbed him - it was as if\na girl was approaching to do battle against him, from\nhis perspective. Juliet : "O\'Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art\nthou, my fair Romeo". I think, in those days, female actors\nplayed the parts of both the males and the females - and so\nperhaps, Shakespeare threw in the word fair, for comedic \npurposes.'

aS'\n\nMortal Instruments :\nCity of Bones.. Interesting movie.\nWhite is used to emphasize, the spiritual.\nHence, the association with snow, ice,\nand blonde, and blue. In contrast, black\nis associated with carnality, sexuality,\nfire (in the kitchen - a symbol of gluttony,\na kind of lust), the colour red. The world\nis a he, whereas the Church is a she..\nThere is an expression in the Bible (kjv),\n"sister-wife". Love, and sexual desire, are\nopposed to each other. In this movie,\npersons are a curious mix of positive-negative,\nblack-white, male-female, love-lust...\nThe 2d symbol, squarish, looks like a swastika\nin disguise, but roundish, a bunny rabbit, or a\nram (male sheep with horns)... Opposites, or\nextremes are emphasized, to establish boundaries,\nit would seem.. "I\'m a werewolf, not a golden \nretriever". Black, masculine; White, feminine.\nSymbolism - 2d versus 3d. A 2d drawing, is different\nthan a sculpture, for the former is more easily seen\nto be a map, whereas the latter - requires explanation.\nReferring to a sculpture, a statue :\n"That\'s the angel, Azareal.." But is he holding a cup, or\na sword, and why? What purpose does a statue serve?\nIs that an exact likeness, or a symbol, and if the latter,\nwhy the detail? The movie is at times about, semiotics, \nand perceptions, opinions, and facts. I found that to be a\nvery interesting, and creative invention - demons hating\nsoft melodies, like the kind Bach wrote : The implication\nbeing that demons find "coarse language, violence, and\nrap music" attractive, pleasant to the ears. Who is who,\nor who is what, a matter of taste?.. This movie, I thought\nwas very brave, and very honest. I liked that Dr.Jekyl\nvs. Mr.Hyde theme - not being able to trust oneself,\nirrespective of "good intentions", and the theme of\ncompassion (or "tolerance"), which the "good guys" had \nfor each other. The movie basically challenges the\naudience to see beyond labels, colours, and symbols, to\nsee who is who, or who is what. Actions, or words, what\ndefines a person? Feelings? Feelings can be repressed,\nlike memories, thoughts.\n\n\nI bought a dvd copy from Wal-Mart, but to my dismay,\nthe video would at times halt, the image on the screen\nbecome pixelated, and audio "skip" - unfortunately, I\ndid not keep the receipt so that I might exchange it for\nanother copy. Do not know how many other defective\ndvd copies are out there, but based on my experience,\nI advise others not to throw away a receipt until they\nhave played the movie, at least once. And no, there were\nno scratch marks on the disc - it was defective. Whether\n"one of those things" or the result of sabotage at the dvd\nfactory, I know not.'

p51
aS"I don't think they should have made it into a movie. the books are so good \nbut there is just too much information for a 2hr movie they should have \nmade it into a show--with a hotter lead guy.
