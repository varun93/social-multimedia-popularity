S'This movie was great. Only those that are considered smart and can pay \nattention are probably best off watching it.'
p1
aS'So what is the point of killing the guy in the past? and having someone \nelse do it, even though the guys sending the victim back very easily can?'
p2
aS'A ver o filme...'
p3
aS'Never heard of this movie...'
p4
aS'This movie is okay, watchable and better than average.'
p5
aS'I really can sleep very tight after watch this movie lol I thought he could \nbe more fun like previous movie I had watched, hate to say but the movie \nreally is boring. '

p8
aS'Great movie'
p9
aS'Check out this video on YouTube:'
p10
aS'Am I the only one wondering WTF happened to Joseph Gordon Levitt? Seriously \nwhat is wrong with his face? After enduring this film I have to say this is \none of the worst I have seen in a awhile. I put this in the same category \nas "In Time", just a horrendous story that makes no sense. So it\'s hard to \ndispose of bodies in the future but getting your hands on a time machine is \neasy? What? WTF?'
p11
aS'Stupid movie! Ugly stupid kid in it too!'
p12
aS'have this at filebook.com.ph'

p17
aS'safsadasdas '
p18
aS"Sorry most of you missed the point of the movie. It wasn't about time \ntravel it was about love and hate. Don't worry love is more powerful then \nanything and having a few resources helps also."
p19
aS'omg I just canttt explain the mixed emotions I had from watching this!! \nlove it! but definitely need to rewatch.'
p20
aS'in your order of thinking you are totally right , but you forgot something \n. We will not live much longer after the real deal , working at 100% . And \nif we live then it will be totally secret and no one will know . Imagine \nthat you are from a government , and you know that they can get into the \npast and change something . You go to tv and spread the notice right ?! , \nthe problem is that you will not finish it because they get you when you \nare young and kill you . So you never spread nothing ;))'
p21
aS'No one seems to care, but I also think that something is really wrong with \nLevitts face.'
p22
aS'stfu'

aS'recommended for people whom have trouble to sleep lol'
p29
aS'nice '
p30
aS'goo movie.more at icefilms.co.nr'
p31
aS'The ending was sad... The kid was definitely unique. The trailer showed \nabout floating and exploding stuff... I thought the world was changing \nbecause they messed with the time itself. But it was just a kid with a \nsuperior brain, ripping bodies apart when he gets mad or hurt. '
p32
aS"Also, sending people with knowledge of a modern civilisation into the stone \nage, means that they will cause total chaos since they are more likely to \nchange history in a fundamental level. Besides we don't know the \nlimitations of time travelling...maybe the further back you go, the energy \nconsuption grows at a geometric scale."
p33
aS'no'
p34
aS'just to say that you are a dumb ass and advice you to go to school to study \n. You dont know who am i and you dont know how much knowledge i have in \nthese matters , you are in knowledge like an ant is in a mans world . I \nwill not reply to you anymore , and you can say whatever you want here \nwhatever it makes you feel happy . In this moment of this post what makes \nme happy was calling you a dumb ass in knowledge .'
p35
aS'Very nice'

aS'you the ugly kid'
p39
aS"you're average. the movies excellent"
p40
aS"I hated the stupidity of the persona's who didn't realize till the end that \nthe kid was the evil one."
p41
aS'Okay, two more questions then. How can you teleport some one somewhere with \nnothing. Meaning, the time machine is a mechanism that you go into and get \nshot into the past right? But how can you appear some where else with out \nthere being another machine that you come out of. There should be two time \nmachines one you into and one you come out of. Also instead of shooting the \nguys 30 years back why dont they just shoot them all the way back into the \nstone age?'
p42
aS'are you freaking serious? anything you see on a movie they have tried doing \nit how you think they come up with these ideas?'
p43
aS"just watched it on moviere.com and it's great movie"
p44
aS'Bruce is the man just watched it on Mixvid'
p45
aS"Well that's where the theory of creations of new universes running parallel \nto ours come into place. Same paradox with Terminator: Cyberdyne (which \ncreated Skynet) did it by using the Terminator sent by Skynet from the \nfuture...but how could have Skynet from the future created the Terminator \nindependently from the past? The theory is that when you travel back in \ntime and change things, a new universe is created. The latest Star Trek was \na good example of that."
p46
aS'yes...but if you go further in the future there will be 100% leak of the \nequation and possible for everyone '
p47
aS'I loved it....!!'
p48
aS'this movie is fucken awesome.'

p54
aS'great movie.watch movies at icefilms.co.nr'
p55
aS"'30 years from now is yesterday'."
p56
aS'it was actually him'
p57
aS"emuly blunt's role is the most sophisticated and down-to-earth female \nsci-fi character i've seen in years. that's more than i can say for \nwhat's-her-face from those crackpot resident evil flicks."
p58
aS'sequel please '
p59
aS"Oh wait I did my research and apparently it's makeup.... Amazing"
p60
aS'So JGL is now, a Baldwin.'
p61
aS'No, that one would be the new universe. The kid with the blood would be the \ncurrent universe, the one they are experiencing, while the other one would \nbe on the "other side" running parallel to it.'
p62
aS'they forgot the B'
p63
aS'Impossible to time travel... You just can get in another universe/dimension \nand change things there...but you wont be able to get back in time in this \nuniverse/dimension... because if we could ,we would be more advanced \nnow/would travel the shit out of it and destroy ourselves... you do \nsomething great?someone else goes back in time and steals the idea...that \nwill go on and on,til there is a terrorist who destroys the pre-human \nrace... would be insane to think about the consequences of it...'
p64
aS'should say joseph gordon-levitt movie.'
p65
aS'fear me I am the Rainmaker!!'
p66

p73
aS'WOW, the amount of thumb whoring going on in these comments is exceptional. \nI hope you all hate yourselves.'
p74
aS'The movie was kinda pointless.'
p75
aS'I guess this is one of those "love it or hate it" movies.'
p76
aS'cause you are too stupid to understand this movie your IQ is too little to \nunderstand movies like this go and watch twilligt i bet you will love \ntwillight lmfao'
p77

aS"Trust me, there's a lot to the movie than this trailer shows, you should \ngive it a shot !"
p80
aS'shit people 200 years ago would say the exact same thing about huge metal \ntubes that transport us all over the globe.'
p81
aS'Jep, the ending made perfect sense! a pity but it was the right choice. \ngood movie.'
p82
aS"Hey, think of also those who haven't watched the movie yet. :P"
p83
aS'Aha the logic is not sound at all. What are you talking about? If Bruce \nWillis gets killed before he can kill the mom to piss of the young Rain \nMaker than that means Willis would have never been sent back in time to be \nkilled because the Rain Maker wouldve not been in control of all the mafias \nand closed all the Loops. This also means that Willis wouldve still had a \nwife and would not have sought out the young Rain Maker. So yeah the logic \ndoesnt make sense but who cares, it was a great movie.'
p84
aS'as soon as it said time travel i clicked the piratebay tab and clicked the \nget this torrent link.'
p85
aS'copy and paste the link in your browser to download them --> \nbit.ly/QFdP4t?6u6kt <--'
p86
aS'It has a 94% rating on Rotten Tomatoes so most people think its good and I \nagree. Great plot, great ending and I love how it does not go overboard \nwith the science fiction. Second best movie of the year. Way better than 12 \nMonkeys. '
p87
aS'He could have shot his arm, but the ending made sense'
p88
aS'what?'
p89
aS'It is him he has make up on to make him look like Bruce Willis'
p90
aS'THE KID! THE KID!!! OH MY GOD, THE KID!!!!!!! HE WAS FUCKING AMAZING!!! SO \nADORABLE AND CUTE!!!!!!! <3'
