aS'THIS MOVE SUCKED BALLS.\nShitty move in my opinion.'
p2
aS"oh sure, they show Kronos rising which never happened in the book, but they \ndon't show Circe that actually did happen in the book!??!"
p3
aS'Stole a ton of shit from harry potter'
p4
aS'WHAT IF THE MOVIES ONLY LOOKED RIDICULOUS BECAUSE THE MIST IS MESSING WITH \nOUR VISION? BECAUSE "THEY" DON\'T WANT REGULAR MORTALS SEEING THE TRUTH \nABOUT GREEK MYTHOLOGY?\n\nOh my gods THAT WOULD BE EPIC!!!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut at the same time, that would also mean I\'m just a regular mortal \nNOOOOOOOO :\'( *sobs at the corner*'
p5
aS'Umm why does Tyson have 2 eyes ? '
p6
aS'am i the only one that notices that clarisse is hot?shes supposed to be \nthis ugly big fat strong beast of a girl,instead she looks like she might \nbe from Hermes or Aphordite, defintly not Ares.Also Annabeth has no grey \neyes they seemed to remember tysons eye but nope not the cloudy eyes of \nAthena :( and annabeth is one of my favorite characters and i will say \nthis, if they did evrything from the book it would be a much better and \nenchanting movie(or movie series).'
p7
aS'Who does Clariese remind me of? The actress? And i kno i spelled it wrong, \njust deal with ut'
p8
aS'I know that the movies are a HUGE difference from the books, but they\'re \nboth terrific! Sure, it\'s very different, but it\'s still great!\nOh, and if anyone of you didn\'t know this, the Titan\'s Curse (the 3rd \nsequel) is happening. \nLogan Lerman said that when he said "it wasn\'t happening", it was taken out \nof context.\nThe movie MAY come out in 2015, but it hasn\'t been confirmed yet by 20th \nCentury Fox.\nBut i assure you, that it will happen. Since Logan Lerman signed a contract \nto 3 films.'
p9
aS'this movie sucked. it was a huge disappointment. The Lightning thief was \ngreat and I waited years for this to come out just to be let down.'
p10
aS'Does anyone know if there will be a third movie?'
p11
aS'I was thinking something more like the lightning theif. Guess i was wrong.'
p12
aS'wait so where does grover go? cus in the book they go looking for grover \nand the fleece.'
p13
aS'Good, They made Changes. Annabeth is Blonde is Curly hair again.They dont \nlook freakin 16. And the Director actually read the book.'
p14
aS'When is the third movie coming out? '
p15
aS"The movie made Clarisse too loveable. Like I know she's bitchy at some \nparts but she really grew on me even though I hated her in the book. The \nactress in my opinion is too pretty to play Clarisse and too small (I \nthought she was supposed to be bigger then Anabeth at least). The \nanimations and stuff were great but they botched the movie and fuckedd up \nthe story line. "
p16
aS'Apparently the directors read the title, back cover, and then went to make \nthe movie. Its a good movie, but terrible in a book to movie ratio.'
p17
aS"Percy Jackson should've been 12 years old boy\nHe met Tyson at his school, not in the Big House.\nChiron should've been fired from Cam Half-Blood, and it got Tantalus \ninstead.\nThere should have been a War Train Race... where was it in the movie?\nGrover was lost from the beginning, not because Luke kidnapped him -__-\nThere should have been 2 bulls... not 1 !!!\nPercy, Annabeth, and Tyson ran away from Camp Half-Blood by riding 3 \nHippocampi, not 1 Hippocampus -_-\nPrincess Andromeda should've been a huge boat consisted of many monsters \nand creatures.\nIn the movie, I just saw Manticore and Laistrygonians... There should've \nbeen more than those !\nPercy, Annabeth, and Tyson fell from the Charybdis together with Clarisse \nand her zombie armies. In the movie, they fell separately.\nThey should've told about Pan!!! Not just because they were looking only \nfor Golden Fleece, but Polyphemus was actually a trap for every Satyrs who \ntried to find Pan.\nHermes shouldn't have showed in a tidy suite!\nWhere was Ares in the movie? \nDid the movie tell us about Skylla? Circe and Hylla? Percy who was turned \ninto a guinea pig?\nThere shouldn't have been such a teleport thing that popped green light \nright before Luke gone away... ._.?\n\nThose are the differences between the book and the movie I can find... \nSorry if there're mistakes... Thanks :)"

aS'fantastic'
p20
aS"I'm a huge fan of the books and after seeing the first crappy attempt at an \nadaptation, I didn't want to see this film. Well I gave a try anyways and I \nhate myself for it. The writers should've REALLY just read the The Sea of \nMonsters so they wouldn't included material from ALL FIVE BOOKS in the \nmovie."
p21
aS'this movie was bootleg '
p22

p23
aS"Heh they changed Annabel's hair "

p27
aS'...They were going to have the oracle? Well... when was that left out? This \nWAS looking rather freaking accurate! Just like how the very first movie \ntrailer for Lightning Thief looked rather accurate... such a let down. '
p28
aS"Damn, today it's already one year since Percy Jackson: Sea Of Monsters came \nout 8/7/2013 :D can't wait for the third hope they start working on it soon \n:O"
p29
aS'Guys can smn tell me how many of books ar ether,and the names?'
p30
aS"I really love this series, I really love Logan as Percy, but I can't hide \nmy disappointment about the adaptation. The series was really amazing, \nthere's a full pack of adventures and beautiful characters there. I hope \nthey can do a remake, as much as possible, great like HP movies. I'm really \nhoping for a remake, though I will surely miss Logan as Percy. :)))) THANK \nYOUUUU. Btw, hello co-demigods! :)"
p31
aS'Wow hold on. Wat happened to the girl from percy jackson and the lightning \nthief?! \n'
p32
aS'wtf?! But in the book, Grover is on a quest to find the God :O'
p33
aS'Grover isnt suppose to be on the quest. ITs suppose to be Percy Annabeth \nand Tyson right? Grover was suppose to be serching for Pan and he gets \ncaptured when he finds the golden fleece instead. So what is this bullshit?'
p34
aS'Watch music?'
p35
aS"They're saying that there's probably not gonna be a movie for The Titans \nCurse and the last book ever of Percy Jackson is coming out in October! \nIt's like a sudden end to my life"
p36
aS'i have read all the books and i love the movies. Especially because the \nmovies look like the books. sometimes you have that movies are nothing like \nte books but this movie is so i really love it!'
p37
aS'A cab? Harry potter?..'
p38
aS"The movie is great. If you think it's wrong for them to change the \nstoryline you should read the books. It's the same thing in a way. Don't \ndisappoint the directors and the cast. They all worked so hard."
p39
aS"have you seen Rick Riordan's reaction on the script. Priceless. He never \nwatched the movies."
p40
aS"I liked it and I haven't read the books yet. On the first movie, it felt \nlike Annabeth & Clarrise got fused. On second movie(this) Annabelle is more \ngirly and less kickass."
p41
aS"They totally butchered these movies, in my opinion. I mean, they would've \nbeen really good if I hadn't read the book so many times."
p42
aS"Fuck these movies. Books>>>>>>>>>>>>> these shitty remake movies. Just \nwatching the trailers I can see so many things wrong. The whole reason that \nthey discover the fleece is because Grover gets caught. Tyson is suppose to \nbe a 6'3 kid who is HUGE not just a medium build. The death taxi is used \ngetting to camp half blood, not after they get there. The cap never splits \nin half. Whirlpool monster(forgot name) only has the teeth in the mouth, \nnot in whirlpool. When they get caught in said whirlpool they are on \nClarisses boat. Olympus is all marble and white and godly looking. What \nthey depict olympus as is basically what Hades palace is describes \nas.(Because it is the opposite of olympus.) Who is that 6 armed mother \nfucker, he isn't a half blood or any monster I can remember from the story. \nThe oracles eyes glowed green not blue, also green smoke, also no candles \nrandomly start burning. Actually Zeus destroyed Kronos.  Kronos is more \nabout taking over the world than revenge. Grover is this shy guy who is \nbasically scared of his own shadow until The Battle of the Labyrinth. And \nit's basically the end of the book! Grovers' character is just portrayed \ntotally wrong. Annabeth doesn't whistle to call the taxi with the three \nsisters. I think she throws a coin onto the ground and says something and \nit sinks in. Tyson almost throws up in the cab, he did not think it was \nawesome. Also Tyson is suppose to talk with emotions of an 8 year old but \nwith a deep voice. Tyson in this when he says it in this has the emotions \nof someone of his age in human years. 1:47 the fuck, nothing like this ever \nhappened. Apollo meets percy on the beach and gives him the winds and \nsupplies while warning Percy of the harpies coming to kill him. Then \nAnnabeth and Tyson run to the beach to join him. Then he summons the \nhypicsdnasndjf (Sea ponies) and then they go to the cruise ship. Not \nwhatever thing they have them do here. The cruise ship was massive not some \nlittle small boat like this thing shows. The scene at 2:05 is false. The \nbulls were already on the mountain side fighting by the time Percy showed \nup and did not bust through any walls/houses. If I missed anything tell me. \nAlso Grover is black. His picture is showed in Percy Jackson and the \nOlympians The Demigod Files."

p54
aS'the movie did not suck.. its just that the movie was far from the book... \n because grover is supposed to be captive or missing in the start of the \nstory and he will be saved by percy and the others the same time as they \nget the fleece... '

So, movies will always be \ndifferent from the book, it's more like a book is an inspiration for the \nmovie, but not exactly the story of the book.People just stop saying things \nlike : i hate the movie because it wasn't like the book, They put out this \nscene and this and this...Sure what are you expecting?The movie can't be 5 \nhours long!Stop hoping that a movie would be like the book because it'll \nnever be this way and otherwise you will be dissapointed all the time.(Just \nmy oppinion)"

p83

I will only say this; this movie is NOTHING like the book, \nso if you have read the books and want to see those characters on screen, \nyou are out of luck, because this movie is awful. If you like the movie, \nthere's nothing wrong with that, I am simply stating my opinion. Thank you."
p84
aS"I don't get what people's problem was with this movie. I read the books and \nstill found this movie entertaining.

In what way did it disappoint \nyou?? :/"
p85
aS"The movie disappointed every single percy jackson fan. They ruined the \nmovie. They keep some parts correct (annabeth's hair, the search for the \nfleece, and thalia) but there are so many differences. Why is grover with \nthem on the quest? Annabeth became flirty. She hugged percy so many times \nin this movie. Tyson, can control the water even hippocampi? I thought \npercy did that. Clarisse was like a big bully girl who hates percy because \nhe broke her spear and also he won in the battle with ares.\nWell, I just hope they will make the titan's curse even better. If they \nwill do that, they will have so much money to earn."
