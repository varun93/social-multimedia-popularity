Shouldn't be suck a surprise though, this is the same guy who \nplayed Eames (Inception), Ricki Tarr (Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy) and then \nf***k'n BANE. Guy's a chameleon."
p71
aS'umm, wow. ok. I did not know that I was not entitled to voice my own \nopinion in any way that I see fit and another thing. I do not believe \nduring the course of my entire explanation of why I like him did I once say \nthat "I am a Tom Hardy know-it-all".

However big a role you feel he played in \nthat film is your perception of it and the film please don\'t apply your \nopinions it to me as if they are fact. smh. '
