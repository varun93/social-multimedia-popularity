S'Hate this movie worst one and I thought Alien 3 was the worst'
p1
aS'totally underrated sequel much better then avp at least lives up 2 stan \nwinstin desghns of predator 2 and aliens.'
p2
aS'what could have been but never was :('
p3
aS"On the real I didn't even know they had made a second one lol"
p4
aS"Yeah this movie maybe of sucked but at least they took it in a different \ndirection this time and decided to be darker and more violent. As the first \nfilm was more of a war epic this was more of the slasher film. This movie \nis terrible but as a AVP movie in its own universe its a fun little dark \npopcorn flick that caters to the elements of Aliens and Predator fairly \nwell. They just try to hard on everything and it was executed quite poorly. \nThe characters are direct copy off's of Ripley, Newt etc"
p5
aS'Ripley at 1:18??'
p6
aS"IMO it was alot better than Paul WS. Anderson's version. Loved this one. \nThe predator was fucking badass."

aS'stit trailer. good movie'
p13
aS'The asshole at 0:39 murdered some old woman a couple days ago. And then he \naccidentally died from a fall trying to escape. '
p14
aS'both of the AvP movies suffered a few flaws, but they still are good \nmovies! people even think James Cameron say it ruined the franchise but as \nit reads on Wikipedia: \'\' After viewing Alien vs. Predator, however, \nCameron remarked that "it was actually pretty good. I think of the five \nAlien films, I\'d rate it third. I actually liked it. I actually liked it a \nlot." So don\'t think all is lost, after they are through with the \nPrometheus and Predators sequel they should try again at the AvP Movies. '
p15
aS'Weird trailer but the movie was ok'
p16
aS'Humans = Terran Aliens/Xenomorph = Zerg Predator = Protoss Predalien = \nHybrid?'
p17
