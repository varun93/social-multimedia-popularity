aS"I honestly laugh at people who watch the Expendables and expect great \nacting and some compelling story. It's obvious there will be holes in the \nmovie, but sometimes you got to let go and get your head out of your ass. \nEnjoy it for what it is, not what it isn't."

p4
aS"well i am just gonna say first you are gonna have people who hate these \nfilms better than what you call action movies today, i find all 3 \nexpandables fucking awesome, i like the fact you have good action and drama \nthrown in and magic comedy moments, problem with action movies today they \ntake their self too serious, years ago you had the action with magic comedy \nthrown in at times. just my opinion, this film i loved, the story is simple \nto follow the action i say is good enough, snipes i am glad is back in \nmovies he was magic here, ford still kicks ass for an old man, stallone \nstill cuts it today teaches action stars today how it is done, \nschwarznegger still magic in his part fun to watch him, bandaras so funny \nin it and holds his own well, jason stathem still magic in his role, \nlunggren wow always good he is, crews still holds his magic love the big \nguy, colture as toll road love this guy ufc legend. mel gibson as the \nvillian outstanding, the rest of the actors are magic even the newcomers. \nthe acting is very good. i don't care if you get people slating this films, \ndon't like them go and watch twilight. overall i think 9 out of 10 i \nenjoyed it. and the direction was good too."
p5

aS"Whether this film is worth anything or not,it's a matter opinion,but I'm of \nthe opinion the cast from the other action flick 'Skin Trade';Michael Jai \nWhite,Peter Weller (they both make real convincing villain characters) & \nTony Jaa,shud all have been absorbed into the next,that is if at all there \nis even another + the likes of those that are not around in any latest \nflicks here,such as Seagal,Yen (Donnie),Ray Park (a.k.a. Darth Maul/Toad of \nX-Men),Mark Dacascos,(S.Korean) Bruce Khan,maybe even familiar faced,small \nrole martial arts usually baddie actors such as James Lew,Al Leong or Roger \nYuan shud be considered.While in this recent installment,many appreciated \nthe return of Snipes in acting circles,the Producers however don't need to \nbe bothered with two other Chinese guys,one a clown,cuz with his \nantiques,he'll essentially kill the film of its significance & the \nother,who thinks he can pass-off as the Chinese version of debonair Clark \nGable or John Wayne,sickens audiences,essentially the two really just don't \ncut it. Nuff sed. "
