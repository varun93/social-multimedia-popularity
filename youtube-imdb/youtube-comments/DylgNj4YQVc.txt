S"Mila Kunas was actually pretty bad in this movie... Not good bad, terrible \nbad. I dunno, her acting as a witch wasn't very fitting for her. Not sure \nabout you guys, but this movie put me to sleep. ;w;"
p1
aS'James Franco <3'
p2
aS"I bet some of the comments below say Johnny Depp would've being better than \nJames Franco as Oz because... Well, it gives you the Alice in Wonderland \nfeeling. And who is the character that sticks out the most, is played very \nwell, and wears a hat in Alice in Wonderland ? The Mad Hatter ! And who \nplays the Mad Hatter ? Johnny Depp ! We're just familiar with Johnny and \nconsider him a great actor. My opinion: Either of them would've being great \nfor Oz"
p3
aS'is it good ?'
p4
aS"My best friends met Franco tonight holy shit :')"
p5
aS'Oy...-'
p6
aS'Shut up, Meg!'
p7
aS'Finally I understand some things of the plot! xD China Girl = The Girl in \nthe circus. The previous assistant who is heartbroken = Theodora. Male \nassistant/friend = Finley. Annie (in love with Oscar and Dorothy\'s mother) \n= Glinda. All the color scenes are the imagination of Oscar, he is "sick" \nafter the cyclone (he doesn\'t die, he survives) and all that scenes are his \nmemories distorted (or maybe he wanted a life like that). Annie said she \ndidn\'t still accepted Gale\'s proposal so maybe she takes care of Oscar but \nhe died later and she decides to accept the proposal or maybe she thinks \nOscar died so she accepted it. One way or another, she got married, she is \nthe mother of Dorothy and that\'s the reason she mentioned Gale.'
p8
aS'Remember seeing this trailer in cinema. When the wicked witch was shown \nappearing in fire at the end, a silence stayed in the audience for nearly a \nminute!'
p9
aS"4.5/10\n\nIt's a huge big budget movie, but it ain't that great to be honest. The \nmovie is visually stunning, maybe even more than a normal Disney flick, but \nit's more about witches & magic than animal attack. I would also have liked \nmore characters which were animals."
p10
aS"I kind of only want to see this because James Franco is in it, and I'd get \nto stare at him for a long time..."
p11
aS'Could anyone else not take the wicked witch seriously because of meg \ngriffin?'
p12
aS'Watching Oz The Great & Powerful '
p13
aS'its like some people here didnt know that this is the story of the wizard , \nOz , not the story of dorothy...so its the story before dorothy come to \nOz..how the wizard , Oz come to the Oz world...Get it?'
p14
aS'Just finished watching this. LOVED IT!!'
p15
aS'Loved this movie especially the releasing of the stars'
p16
aS'Tea pot land with a stick of glue '
p17
aS'James Franco can never do anything wrong.  And Sam Raimi is an amazing \ndirector.  Awesome cast, beautiful set design, great back story.  Loved it!'
p18
aS"don't look at the recommended videos if you don't want to see a huge \nspoiler"
p19
aS'Yes I want yo see it'
p20
aS'I really think Oz is dead in limbo. There are many signs in the movie. This \nis my theory! or perhaps he\'s dreaming... but for me he\'s definitely dead \nin limbo. That\'s why the soundtrack is "Almost home"'
p21
aS"i really can't help but pity theodora really =*= she didn't even get any \nredemption and that dorothy killed her with water really =*="
p22
aS'How many movies have wee seen in recent history with badass trailers that \ngenerally turned out to be forgettable and unimpressive? It\'s sometimes \njust because studios have thrown together a film with a recognizable name \nand a flashy trailer to sucker people into buying a ticket, but what it \nreally comes down to is advanced technology eclipsing genuine storytelling. \nThe Wizard of Oz had cardboard setpieces and was still better than Oz the \nGreat and Powerful, because touching that child-like sense of fantasy and \nwonder will win over hi-tech CGI any day. "But kids won\'t like it if it\'s \nold-fashioned!" Tell that to 450 million Harry Potter books.  '
p23
aS'to a beauiful chick to a scary witch'
p24
aS"I saw this film yesterday, it's really good - watch it!"
p25
aS'Was so much better then I originally thought.'
p26
aS"I'm watching it right now..."

p39
aS"I knew that was Mila Kunis! ~wasn't sure until now~"
p40
aS'GET TO DA CHOPPAAA'
p41

p47
aS'it took me the entire movie to realize that Oscar is Harry Osborn from \nSpiderman'
p48
aS"The movie really melted my manly heart. It wasn't perfect but I still I \nreally liked. Unfortunately, I think Michelle Williams was a bit of a \nmiscast, other than that the rest did great job and I would have loved to \nwatch another 2 hours of this beautifully crafted world. I recommend \nwatching it when you feel down - guaranteed to make you feel better."
p49
aS'prequel'
p50
aS'no way! Harry OZborn was perfect!'

p59
aS"actually i didn't really like this movie. it's somehow boring.. and i love \nthe original version so much, that's why.. i think the best character in \nthis movie is only the monkey. he's so funny"
p60
aS'I just saw it in 3D as well ..very good ..I actually was blinking and \ntrying to move out the way as things were comming at me'

p70
aS"I haven't seen the movie yet but the trailer had me laughing out loud. I \ncan't wait to watch it. Also I liked the return to the original, ie. \nstarting in 4.3 black and white, but when switching to color going to \nbeyond 16.9 a nice touch for a trailer. :)"

p76
aS"i just saw this movie and it's fantastic, it was like the Alice in \nWonderland...i mean like a strange movie,different of the real story"
p77
aS'for those who dont know its prequel'
p78
aS"Clanki u are so right! I was sooo disappointed in this movie. I was hoping \nthey kept the accents and storyline and acting based of the first one but \nthey didn't. Oz made out with every single woman in the movie..wth man! \nUgh..way to destroy a film"
p79
aS'pre'
p80
aS'totally agree... they keep destroying awsome titles! It was even crappier \nthan Alice... '
