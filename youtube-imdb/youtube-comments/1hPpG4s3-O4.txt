I believe \nthey tried to hard into making it into a comedy which only Robert Downey jr \ndoes in the iron man films to be fair, but charachters like thor for \nexample, I love his 2 Thor movies and he's probably my favourite charachter \n(and Loki obviously) but they completely changed what his charachteris like \nwhich disappointed me :("
