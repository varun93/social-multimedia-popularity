p2
aS'This movie FAILS in one very important way. It features Justin Beiber \nmusic. Another much less significant way this movie fails is that Santa can \ndeliver presents another way, nanotechnology for the toys and portals that \ngo through time and space for delivery.'

aS"@ScrubmanLowell Muppets, if there's any justice in the world."
p32
aS"@jfkrakowski Oops. I mean little children being used for elf helpers. Sorry \n:3 I find it sweet too that Arthur wants to help out in any way possible! \nBut I'm just annoyed by movies who use little children as elf helpers. It's \nso saccharine sweet it disgusts me."
p33
aS'@DemiandSelenafanone really!?'
p34
aS'@3zaldo i agree'

p53
aS'I think I remember that one elf clip from prep.and landing'
p54
aS'@TheCoolmuffins Just because someone answers letters that little kids send \nto Santa doesn\'t mean they have a mental illness; they could just be that \nrare creature called a decent human being and want to help kids believe in \nSanta Claus. It\'s no different than the writer of Dear Abby answering her \nfans\' letters. Or that movie "Letters to God".'
p55
aS"Is anyone else annoyed how all of these movies now make Santa's \n'organization' all high-tech and spy-related???"
p56
aS'@Jasminsteral My thoughts exactly! XD'
p57
aS'When I saw Arthur answering a letter, I thought he was some creep with a \ndemented mind, that sends letters to children about Santa being real \nbecause he has some mental illness?'

p61
aS'This commercial is certainly better than the other commercials for this \nmovie. Although I hope the film is way better than the commercials.'
p62
aS'I VERY neally met James McAvoy today :('
p63
aS'NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND!!!!!!!!!'
p64
aS'Tin Tin got competition'
p65
aS'That ship looks so much like a ship from star trek... but looks kinda cool \nxD '
p66
aS'@PRIORITY60 Just as annoyed as Santa having little kids for helpers.'
p67
aS"I'M THINKING OF AUTHUR BUSTER AND DW I feel so silly"
p68
aS'@ztslovebird When I first saw it (out of context),I just thought it was sad \nand kind of strange that a random guy was the one answering childrens santa \nletters'
p69
aS'Is the childs voice at the beginning Karen from Outnumbered ?'
p70
aS'Hugh Laurie! :D "B-b-b-b-Bambi?" xD'
