S"For me it there was quite boring movie, I don't love such movies fighters \nto a floor comedy. In the 90th such movies americans let out. If not death \nof one of the main positive characters of Deby this movie would be the pure \nfighter the comedy. Silly, when at the end of the movie blew up money, the \nmain characters didn't begin to collect the notes which have settled on the \nearth. At the end of the movie one positive main character shoots at a foot \nto other positive main character, it was made because shooting before told \nthat it will make it. There are many people why that (for giving of the \nimportance, brightness the words) which are spoken by radical things and \nthen don't do them, the hero of the movie shooting at a foot was not from \nsuch people. here and in this movie say that CIA is involved with drug \ntraffic"
