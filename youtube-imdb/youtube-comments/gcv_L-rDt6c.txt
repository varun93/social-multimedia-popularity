S'So alien "intelligent" life is invading earth with full knowledge of our \ntechnological advancements, armed to the teeth ready to fight human forces. \nHere we have a couple skinny ass teenagers with maybe some education and no \nreal training "fighting back" against these aliens? Hmm, no thanks.'

aS'saw this yesterday. great movie :)'
p60
aS"@michaelkellyLAD that's what i was thinking about"
p61
aS'@metallic51, I liked it at least it was centered somewhwere else than NYC \nor LA in the U.S. The concept of energy shielded Aliens was very \ninteresting, & the fact that unlike in most Alien Invasion movies the \nmilitary is not there to play GiJoe was a reminder of Cloverfield. The fact \nthat the Russians save the day, riding electrically armored horses like \nknights is the most fun about it. Also, like Skyline it leaves an opening \nfor a sequel after devastating Earth & its defenses. '
p62
aS'@9879novo Also, its a whole fuckload cheaper to NOT animate unnecessary \nstuff like aliens, so making them invisible is a good idea. think about \nyour insults and why someone might have done something before you \nimmediately go to rant on them'
p63
aS"Its totaly worth watching, i'd give it a 6.5 / 10. I watched this in the \ncinema and i was like fuck this movie when the dog died tho"
