S'There are so many things wrong with this movie is hard to know where to \nbegin. SPOILER ALERT\n\n- How did the lions make it to America?\n- The scene where the dog gets hurt: the "vampires" set up a trap, he gets \npulled up by his leg, the dogs attack, but the "smart" vampires stay back, \nwhy? if the dogs can attack, why couldn\'t they?\n- He states "[the vampires] have no higher brain function. They don\'t \nplan...", and yet he\'s been trapped by a sophisticated trap, and by luring \nhim placing one of the mannequins in the middle of a street.\n- The CGI suck.'

aS'Wow this movie is exactly what is going on now. In this movie it talks \nabout a virus that is airborne and people being quarantined. Does this \nsound familiar to what is now going on ? ebola virus ? This movie came out \nin 2007 and here we are in 2014 and there is great concern from the WHO and \nCDC that this could spread. They are lying to the public about it now being \nairborne. Than why do you see men suited up in bio suits with respirator \nboxes on ? Take a good look at the men and you will see the boxes with \ntubes strapped on them. I\'m watching this movie right now and looking for \nany clues or hidden messages because this is how the elites communicate to \none another. In one scene I saw a poster mocking God "God Still Loves Us". \nThey had this planned all along and they want to reduce the population to \n500 million. This is probably why they got a patent on the ebola virus. Go \nread the Georgia guidestones and you will see written in stone. I\'d you \nhave not seen this movie "I Am Legend" I recommend it so you know what is \ngoing on. This movie is not for children. \n\nGOD IS IN CONTROL & HIS PROTECTION IS UPON US \nDON\'T BE SCARED BE PREPARED!!!'

p6
aS'one of my Favorite movies of all times '
p7
aS'Do yourself a favor and read the book. The movie has terrible CGI and is \npretty much a generic zombie movie. The book which this film is "based on" /\n"adaptation of" coughtotallydifferentcough, is so much better, especially \nfor its time.'

p20
aS'So, Will Smith was the real monster. He was kidnapping, experimenting, and \nkilling those vampires. To them Will Smith was  a legend..like a Boogeyman. \nIf you catch my drift. '

Except possibly for the Tolkiens, who \nwould probably have wanted him to go exactly by the book..."

aS'I could overlook the fact the gasoline would have gone bad but this movie \nquickly went down hill after he was saved by the woman and kid. His never \nbothering to ask where they came from and if there are others plus him \ntelling her "everyone\'s dead!!" was not reasonable. He said himself there \nare millions of survivors in the next sentence.   '
p35
aS'I wonder why its drama not horror ( to me it was comedy )'

p37
aS'Just like minecraft'
p38
aS'Good movie although I consider Los Angeles as in both the novel by Richard \nMatheson and in The Omega Man (1971) the proper city for this movie but New \nYork City was chosen. Will Smith plays a lone survivor whose fortified \nhouse is attacked at night by vampire/zombies'
p39
aS"I've seen this movie it's actually the sadest film I have watched because I \nlove dogs so much and I have a baby sister so that's sad to because when \nthe child died but if it wasn't sad it would've bin epic but you can't have \nlife without death"
