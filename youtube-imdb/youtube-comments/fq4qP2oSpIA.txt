S"This film looks so rubbish! I didn't laugh once! It's defenitly a film that \nthat's for kids & for kids only!"
p1
aS'The rat looks like Remey the rat from Ratatouille.'
p2
aS'10% on Rotten Tomatoes. Yep, will be avoiding this!\nAlso, 0:53 is a rip off of Ice Age!'
p3
aS"this must be the creators of over the hedje and ratatouille bring's u a new \nfunny movie called the nut job!!"
p4
aS'OVER THE HEDGE RIPOFF!!!!'
p5

p6
aS"It very very bad !\nAnd very very stupid\nI'm in a nutshell"
p7
aS'This looks like the same old family movie to be honest. Sorry, not family \nmovie... Kids movie.'
p8
aS"I've see this movie on 1th of august 2014"
p9
aS'Can someone explain to me why every copy of this film has a universal logo \nat the beginning, except the one on Netflix!?!?'
p10
aS"Over the hedge... It's the same"
p11
aS"People are hating on this movie way more than I thought on Rotten Tomatoes. \nThis movie was awesome. It's one of the better animated movies I've seen \nrecently. This movie is close up there with Toy Story 3. I said it. The \nmovie that had you all balling like a baby and laughing hysterically at \nSpanish Buzz is amazing and The Nut Job was just as great. They actually \nkill the bad guys! Grant it there is no blood and it's off screen but rats \nget trapped in rat traps and I was like YES, finally an animated movie that \nkills off the hench men instead of them just getting bonked on the head. \nThey were evil looking. Like the evil rat in Lady and the Tramp, except \nthey were more detailed and street crazy. Watch this"
p12
aS'I went to the cinema and it was a U not a PG'
p13
aS'so Over the Hedge? '
p14
aS'the concept of the movie reminds me more like Over the hedge :)'
p15
aS'is it just me or does this look almost exactly the same as over the hedge'
p16
aS"The anti-Scott Walker ad before the trailer is nothing but pure lies and \ncommunist bu!!$h/t. Scott Walker saved Wisconsin from ruin by the previous \nlibtard administration, and we're now open for business. "
p17
aS'on a lighter note, but jus as importante; "ANIMALS R CONTROLLED BY THE \nAMOUNT OF FOOD THEY HAVE. IT\'S OUR DUTY TO KEEP IT FROM THEM"\ndid a genius write this movie r jus 1 WHO sees? watch the filcc, laff now, \nthere will b a time when U wont laff about this...'
p18
aS'Looks like they ripped the model for the squirrel in this film from Hammy \nin Over the Hedge... Exactly the same '
p19
aS"Will Arnett and Liam Neeson are talented actors, but even they couldn't \nsave this movie. Bland, lame, mean-spirited, annoying, unfunny, and lacking \nin anything special. And it's getting a sequel? Oh boy....."
p20
aS'Was a ok movie laughed a lot but there are better ones at least thats my \nopinion'
p21
aS'more than greatest painter'

p26
aS'is it just me, or does he sound like draven from league? o.O'
p27
aS'Is it me or does the purple squirrel look kinda like Hammy from the movie \nOver the Hedge? '
p28
aS'Sad to see people call this a "rip-off", when really, every movie has \ncopied main stuff before... >_>\n\nAlso, I notice a lot of new animations get negative reviews maybe and I \nthink it\'s best not to listen to critics (They often don\'t even use \n"Critique", just personality thoughts I think) and watch this your self.. \nAnything often that isn\'t from Pixar often gets unnecessary negativity just \nbecause the quality "isn\'t" even as "great" as Pixar, when yet it doesn\'t \neven have to in order to be good.'
p29
aS'Too many fart jokes'
p30
aS'isnt that dog john smiths dog from pocahontas by Disney?! :o'
p31
aS'I liked the asian rapper at the end and the cardinal the bestB-) '
p32
aS'Brandon.Fraser.Ruins.Everything.'
p33
aS"This was actually a fine movie there's a part that was emotional."
p34
aS"Ok, so I'v watched this movie simply because it was available on Netflix \nand I must say, I actually enjoyed it. Yes, the plot was predictable for \nthe most part, but I enjoyed how each character developed especially the \nrelationship between Surly and Buddy the rat which has to be my favorite \ncharacter in the entire film. I'm not a kid, but I still liked and enjoyed \nthe film plus it incorporated a very nice message about friendship, \nloyalty, and trust. So I would say it's good for anyone who loves animated \nfilm such has ice age and what not. :)"
p35
aS'Too much comic violence, if I directed this film I would have treated it \nlike one of the greatest paintings of all time not a sitcom with too much \nhumor and stupidity within the characters.'
p36
aS'Watched it... Haha the song is OPA GANGNAM STYLE'
p37
aS'It would seem that the fun police have sucked the joy from your very lives. \nThe comments are generally picky and clearly written by 70 year old women \nwho think bingo is an adrenaline fueled rush. \nComments like this is a film for kids, even though ridiculous are true. \nTake your head out of your ass and enjoy the fart jokes!'
p38

p42
aS"I don't like this movie same as Free Birds."
p43
aS'This film makes me lose faith in humanity'
p44
aS"Mindless crap. When are we going to have real people and animals in films \ninstead of all this CGI rubbish. At least I don't have a child called \nGerren ?? WTF :-("
p45
aS'You can watch this on pornhub'
p46
aS"I am seeing lots of areas where this movie might fail.\nBut I'm also seeing potential.\nI'm very cautiously optimistic at this point."

aS"Everyone's saying this movie looks like crap. That's what I thought until I \nactually did see it, I was VERY surprised at how much I liked it. The \ncharacters were awesome, the jokes and comedic stuff were perfectly timed \nand executed, the storyline was pretty decent, and the soundtrack was good \n(Spoiler alert, Gangnam style is only used twice. Once during a 50 second \nmontage and during the credits so if you hate the song like I do, you won't \nhave to worry much.) "
