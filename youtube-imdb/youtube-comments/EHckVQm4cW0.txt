S'Great movie, not a very good trailer. '
p1
aS'Shiva is god of destruction bot death'
p2
aS'I watched this when I was 12 and was like "this is the most boring \npointless movie I\'ve ever seen." watched it again at 15, now I think it\'s \nintelligent and intense as hell, such a good movie!'
p3
aS'A truly great performance by Clooney. Also 10 out of 10. Fox Cruton.'
p4
aS"Clooney was nominated and I was stunned he didn't win. He did a great job \nin this film. He was a guy who had been able to adjust the truth his whole \nlife and now he is dealing with what appears to be the biggest cover up of \nhis career. Clooney is more than just a good looking romantic lead and this \nmovie is a perfect example of that."
p5
aS"Tom Wilkinson's monologues in this film were AMAZING. I wish I could speak \nlike that."
p6
aS'you are right!'
p7
aS"My Cousin Vinny (1992, comedy), The Insider (1999) starring Russel Crow, A \nFew Good Men (1992) starring Tom Cruise That's all I can think of now"
p8
aS'no country and there will be blood were mad movies. clayton is a corporate \nlaw firm horse shit. now dont get me wrong movie is written very tight and \nsmart I just didnt like the setting or any of the charachters'
p9
aS"this movie doesn't amount to Atonement or No Country, and i'd be willing to \nsay There Will Be Blood but haven't seen it yet... i think they just needed \nto put up a movie in the nominations that had good actors, because 2007 \ndidn't have a surplus of amazing pictures... does anyone agree 07' released \nmore parody/terrible comedies than any other previous year? i swear this \nyear made it easy for the great movies to standout because of the amount of \ncrap that came out"
p10
aS'good acting, good movie for smart people. Feel sorry for the bitch at the \nend of the movie though....'
p11
aS'yeah im sure all the two people, including you, who even watched the movie \nwith the commentary are going to notice that huge error, my god!!!!'
p12
aS'It\'s stupid that i took vantage point as an example, because I don\'t think \nthe movie is that great.I just wanted to point out, that it\'s even worse \nthan vantage point. And you kind of right, that vantage point is more the \n"for idiots"-type of movie.But Michael Clayton isn\'t that "intelligent" as \neveryone says.The Plot is quite simple.And everybody here is proud, that \nthey understood the very complex story.I knew what will happen from nearly \nthe beginning. So that\'s why i wasn\'t impressed by it.'
p13
aS'Actually "Yama" is the god of death'
p14
aS"In my opinion Tom Wilkinson is one of the greatest actors of all time! I \ndon't think the academy watched the whole movie cause I think george should \nhave won best actor tom should have won best supporting actor and it should \nhave won best picture but just my opinion."
p15
aS'Really good movie.'
p16
aS'why would u name this movie after its main character? bullshit clooneys \ntryin to re-create already-seen classic movies with alot less taste'
p17
aS"Lmao you're hilarious."
p18
aS'lmfao i am shiva the god of death'
p19
aS'How good is this movie/??? do you need to know about legal issues to enjoy \nit??'
p20
aS'Great thriller with brilliant ending. Tom Wilkinson and George Clooney were \nstunning'
p21
aS'@ clicktotouch Fracture is really good'
p22
aS'just finished watching it. All I can really say is wow. This truly is film \nat its best.'
p23
aS"i saw this movie before any of the other nominations for best picture, and \nlong after i have seen the others i still feel this one was the most \ncomplete of any nomination. Don't get me wrong, TWBB and No Country were \nboth very good as well but this should have won."
p24
aS'lol i didnt get the movie at all'
p25
aS'How good is this movie/??? do you need to know about legal issues to enjoy \nit??'
p26
aS'Great thriller with brilliant ending. Tom Wilkinson and George Clooney were \nstunning'

p29
aS"i saw this movie before any of the other nominations for best picture, and \nlong after i have seen the others i still feel this one was the most \ncomplete of any nomination. Don't get me wrong, TWBB and No Country were \nboth very good as well but this should have won."
p30
aS'lol i didnt get the movie at all'
p31
aS'damn good'
p32
aS'@guyinyoureye Its simple'
p33
aS"Realm and Conquest. I think it's real."
p34
aS'oh yeah in my opinion this is one of the greatest movies of all time!!!'
p35
aS"@brickbusterful Glad to see you have grown up a bit. I never thought this \nmovie was boring when it first came out but I did not understand it. I've \nsince seen it and I think it is George Clooney's best acting role today. \nThe stress and pressure of covering up a scandel within your company, that \nsame feeling dealing with a corporation that only has greed on their mind, \netc. The shocking thing is seeing Clayton not go postal. Michael Clayton \nhas intelligent dialogue, intensity, and is a great film"
p36
aS"I don't know why lot of people didn't like this movie?...This is one of the \nbest movies I have ever seen...the background score...is just \nbreathtaking.....the colour of the movie,.......just perfect....can't get \nany better......I loved it I saw it like 7 times in last 10 \ndayz........z.............N George Clooney....should have got an Oscar for \nthis.........Again...my opinion......Thankx...."
p37
aS'Watched it last night; fantastic.'
p38
aS'This movie was predictable, no twist or turns. Two thumbs down.'
p39
aS'he got an oscar for it..'
p40
aS'this movie is awesome man .....sure deserves an oscar...'
p41
aS'Yes sorry, was "No country"...But i think Michael Clayton was the best \npicture of thr year...'
p42
aS'its not like he edited the movie. it probably wasnt his version.'
p43
aS'Here\'s whatcha do... rent a little TV/DVD combo - they\'re cheap. Put in a \ndisc of "Terminator 3" or Bad Boys 2" or "Die Hard 4" or something like \nthat. Every time you need an explosion or vehicle pileup to keep you awake, \njust switch on the volume for that movie. Simple! Even you might be able to \ndo it.'
p44
aS'This is a beautiful legal thriller with a very good cast.'
p45
aS"umm. No Country for old Men won the oscar for best picture. unless you mean \na different award Micahel Clayton was not in the league of the films that \nwere nominated, but to be fare neither was juno and atonement. A good movie \nbut not a oscar contender. hey, look at citizen kane that didn't win best \npicture and it's considered a masterpiece, the greatest movie ever made. so \none day maybe you:ll be laughing at us. oh and there will be blood was \nfantastic so i'll get you for that."
p46
aS"This was a great film, unfortunate that it's in a loaded field of worthy \nnominees. I thought Tom Wilkinson was top-notch in this film, only for his \nbest supporting actor award probably to be snatched by Javier Bardem."
p47
aS'ur a retard'
p48
aS'I tried REALLY hard to like this movie.. After hearing nothing but good \nthings, this movie really let me down. I may give it another chance \nsometime, but not anytime soon.'
p49
aS'Even I had no idea what the film was about.'
p50
aS'this is one of my all-time favorite movies....the ending was just amazing!'
p51
aS"I just saw this Movie and i think it isn't good at all. Good Cast, but the \nstory isn't anything special and the Film has much too much Dialogs or \nScenes they could have left out. Vantage point, I saw 2 days ago, i liked \nmuch more."
p52
aS'I really, really enjoyed this film!'
p53
aS"could any one tell me what is the movie about coz i didn't get it"
p54
aS'Umm, KissKara, Michael Clayton and No Country and There Will Be Blood are \nhardly action movies. They are rather slow dramas with a psychological \nthrilling aspect. They are hardly "surface" films, as you suggest. On the \nsurface, they seem slow and unorganized. Once you get into them, however, \nyou realize that they are much much much more than that.'
p55
aS'I\'m talking about the fuckin performances and how powerful the other \nnominees were compared to george. Just because his acting wasn\'t as \nimpressive doesn\'t mean I DON\'T "UNDERSTAND" the film. Have you UNDERSTAND \nthe ACTING of all the other films?'
p56
aS'This movie is a masterpiece. The time will give it the honor place. There \nwill be blood, (very bad)won the oscar. THAT was a mistake.'
p57
aS"There Will Be Blood, No Country For Old Men, Michael Clayton, and what \nother two? oh, juno and atoment... i watched Juno and i liked it very much \nbut i don't understand how this film can stand those 3 movies. an evil oil \nman, an very evil assasin, and a janitor VS this little cute prego teen... \nthough this cute prego teen filmed racked $100m... i'll be watching Oscar \nthis time."
p58
aS'Just go see it!'
p59
aS'@RealTime88 yes he did a great job BUT not over Daniel-Day Lewis in There \nWill Be Blood'
p60
aS'look, the dude was arrested for running naked. he was crazy.'
p61
aS'Shiva is NOT the god of death - Shiva is god of destruction. YAMA is the \ngod of death'
p62
aS'Wow man, this movie was so fucking great. GREAT GREAT GREAT. SMART SMART \nSMART'
p63
aS'Greatest hollywood movie of all time....greater than the godfather and \nterminator'
p64
aS'you may need to watch it a couple times before you understand it'
p65
aS'i am Shiva the god of death'
p66
aS'solid'
p67
aS'did you even try to understand the plot, or were you just too stupid to \nunderstand the complexities of it?'
p68
aS"It's a good movie but it's not for everybody."
p69
aS'Gets 9/10 from me :D BTW ( MOVIES ACE . C0M) is giving it away as a freebie \nright now. Thats where i watched it anyway :)'
p70
aS'INDEED! British babes rule! Hollywood is half European actually!'
p71
aS"wooow it's wondeful listen that in the original language!!! I love this \nfilm!*_*"
p72
aS'Is it me or does George Clooney look like Max Payne in this movie????'
p73
aS'i really love the ending its pretty sad =('
p74
aS"yesterday i watched this at Arclight, it was just great film!!! george \ncloony was so good (of course, everyone was fucking great) that i didn't \nsee george cloony but i saw michael clayton. well deserved to be an oscar \nnominee. but, then there's Daniel Day-Lewis... this years oscar will be \nvery interesting."
p75
aS'go take an econ course in college'
p76
aS"Had Michael Clayton been even slightly successful in bringing down \nBritain's largest crime family then I'm sure he'd of checked his rear-view \nmirrors at least once during the entire film... unlike Henri Paul."
p77
aS'what is the name of the book his son gives arthur ? and is this book just \nfictional for the movie or is it a real book?'
p78
aS"i didn't understand this movie at all!!"
p79
aS'basically, think of it in real life, notice the milk labels in your milk \ncontainers say "no rBST rBGH hormone added", Canadian Health Ministry found \nthat these hormones cause cancer,esp breast cancer to women. We have \n"Monsanto" in real life that produces these hormones 4cow farmers so they \ncan get more milk at a faster rate at the expense of gettin cancer,pretend \nthat Tilda Swinton is part of the monsanto company,& she hires a killer \n4the lawyer that found other health dangers in their products'
p80
aS"Bellissimo film. L'ho visto almeno 5 volte negli ultimi 10 giorni. Mio \nappena esce in BluRay."
p81
aS'Was a satisfying movie. I love the look on Tilda Swinton\'s face when she \ngoes "you don\'t want the money?" and Clayton takes her picture with a \ncellphone right after she was caught on "tape" accepting a blackmail deal. \nI\'ll admit the pace is ponderously slow...but mysterious at that. I watched \nthe ending 3x just to see the climax again. Sweet payoff. Not as great as \n"The Game" but damn good.'
p82
aS'love the look on her face, and the line by michael clayton "you are so \nfucked" just awesome'
p83
aS'I am Shiva the God of death.'
p84
aS'Just watch the movie. The less you know about it, the more you will love it.'
p85
aS"@RealTime88 yes clooney was great. the writer and director to this movie \n(tony Gilroy) didnt win any oscars but he shouldve. it wasnt nominated for \nbest editing but it should have been. the editing was done by gilroy's \nbrother john gilroy. all the actors shouldve won for their roles, tony \ngilroy should of won for writing and directing, john shouldve won for \nediting, and it shuda won for best picture."
p86
aS'This is a great film. No further comment required.'
p87
aS"What the hell are you talking about??? I'm just saying that it is very odd \nthat the director of a movie would make such a huge mistake like that on \nthe DVD!! I LOVED Michael Clayton, hence why i bought it! But its just find \nstrange that the actual director did not know what was going on in his own \nmovie as he watched it!!"
p88
aS'lol i didnt get the movie at all'
p89
aS'yep. crash was so cheeseball i was squirming in my seat. unsurprising, \nthough, that crash is what hollywood types take as "truthful, moving \nethnographic study." so dumb!'
p90
aS'it sucks'
p91
aS'this was an INCREDIBLE movie wilkinson deserved that oscar 10 times \nover!!!!!!!'
p92
aS'please crash deserved it all the way!!!! it should have won all the oscars \nit was nominated for!!!'
p93
aS'great movie i think it should have won for best screenplay and best \ndirector. tony gilroy is great and the editing done by his brother john \ngilroy is superb. tom wilkinson should have won for best supporting and \nclooney should have won for best actor. i think tilda swinton won for best \nsupporting. its just a great movie on my top 5 list. '
p94
aS'George is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!! movie very good'
p95
aS'george clooney played good. end of the movie is good. good movie.'
p96
aS"Did anybody buy the Michael Clayton DVD and watch the movie with Tony \nGilroy's commentary? He makes a HUGE error in it. In the commentary Gilroy \ntalks about the scene at the bar after Arthur dies when Clooney goes to see \nPollack. Gilroy says that after this scene, Pollack goes back to the office \nand the opening late night office scene at the begenning takes place, BUT \nin actuality, that scene does not happen til the next night in the movie. \nHUGE screw up by Gilroy. And this is on the DVD!!"
