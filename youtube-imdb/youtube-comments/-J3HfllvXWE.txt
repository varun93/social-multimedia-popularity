aS"#CaptainAmerica. Don't you think he's the worst #soldier of all time? He's \nbeen in the army since #WW2, and he is still a Captain (that's almost 60 \nyears without a promotion). What's more tragic is since Captain America \n(Trademarked) name has been identified as a symbol for #freedom, there is \nno chance in hell he'll ever be promoted to Major America. Think of the \npaperwork involved for the re-branding. The marketing will be a nightmare."
