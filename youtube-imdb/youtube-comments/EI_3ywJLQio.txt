S'Hey I love that dinner'
p1
aS"Ha! I can't believe their making this look like a romantic comedy. -_- When \nin reality it was no where near that! This film was emotional and it spoke \nmore volumes to actual people who have gone through similar situations such \nas this than any movie I have ever seen before! Can't wait to show this to \nmy family!!! :D"
p2
aS'Still better than The Fault In Our Stars,i think.'
p3
aS'This seems sad because tommy died and now she runs with pat to have a \nfriend aww. :)'
p4
aS'great movie. Very realistic and close to home.'
p5
aS'Sad Story'
p6
aS"Best movie ever! I have watched it like 10 times a yeah before. And still \ncan't help but smile while watching the trailer."
p7
aS"This trailer doesn't do it justice. Such a phenomenal movie."
p8
aS'Now'
p9
aS'The head and the heart - Lost in my mind'
p10
aS"Exactly what I was thinking. It's kinda sad they try to label it as a \nromantic comedy when it's actually so much more than that."
p11
aS'This movie brought to light mental illness in the best way possible. \nyoutube.com/watch?v=BnLAsEMzIqA'
p12
aS"Big fan of Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper. This looks interesting. \nNot sure if it's a must see in the cinema. I will wait to see what Roeper \netc have to say about it"

p15
aS'0:40 Anupam Kher!!!!'
p16
aS"i'm surprised how well it did all the previews i saw on tv gave no \ninformation as to what the movie is about. generally it seems like a good \nidea to put a little of the plot in the commercials i think "
p17
aS'song?!?!??!'
p18
aS'what the fuck is the song in this trailer?'
p19
aS'this movie is great'

p25
aS'The Llanerch Diner is fucking delicious!'
p26
aS'Bad movie'
p27
aS"I wish there were more feel-good films that are actually descent and have a \nmeaning. David O. Russell is awsome and so are the actors especially \nBradley Cooper who's really come a long way since Hangover and all. And \nthey're all so good put together they have chemistry.."
p28
aS"Planning on seeing it this weekend... can't wait!"
p29
aS'This film hit every note just right. Everything I\'d want to see in a \n"family dramedy" type movie...was shown plus more. It was sad but only in \nthe way that you sympathize for the characters...all of them. Every \nperformance was amazing..also glad to see Robert de Niro in one of his \nbetter performances in years. the man knows how to put you on the verge of \ntears. Reminds me so much of my father...everyone in the movie feels like \nsomeone you know..or wish to help. VERY good film.'

Then there were the Police coming to check for guns when I hate guns \nand what;s the correlation between guns and Bipolar ???"

p42
aS'this movie and the actors mean alot to me. cannot wait to get the dvd'
p43
aS'Saw this movie last night at TIFF. It\'s excellent. Bradley Cooper and \nJennifer Lawrence have really good chemistry together. Yes, the movie is a \nlittle predictable and not overly "groundbreaking" but the situations and \ndialogue are real and the emotions are genuine. It\'s snappy and fast-paced, \nalmost like a Aaron Sorkin project. None of it feels forced like is all too \ncommon these days and you\'re really rooting for Pat and Tiffany to get \nbetter.'
p44
aS'Incredible movie! Amazing acting! Great job making this movie. '

aS'I just watched "Breakfast at Tiffany\'s" yesterday. The supposed definitive \nromantic movie. "Silver Linings" is MUCH better - just as oddball \ncharacters, but more believable. For me, this movie is the new benchmark \nfor "Romantic Comedy Dramas"'
