aS"Life takes a different form depending on who you are. Some think the value \nin life is in breathing as long as possible, some see it in making families \nor duty. Some, like those in this movie, think that the thrill of death \nhanging over their heads is what makes life worth living. I live for \nknowledge, so I have no intention of risking my life in races, however I \nwill watch this movie because these people fascinate me. It's nothing to do \nwith propaganda - The world just likes gutsy people."

aS"He doesn't recycle music he just has his own style, just like thomas \nnewman, howard shore, john powell. Zimmer is experimenting more and more \nwith his music and lately he's chosen a lot of low sounding \ninstruments(dont know the official term) such as the cello here, the brass \ninstrument in inception and the experibass in sherlock holmes. If you \nlisten to his stuff pre-Dark Knight(2008) its completely different to his \nmusic now."
