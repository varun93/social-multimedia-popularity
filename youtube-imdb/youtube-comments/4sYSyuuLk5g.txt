aS'"Her name was Ebola~~ She was a showgirl.\nWith yellow feathers in her hair and a dress cut down to there\nShe would merengue and do the cha-cha\nAnd while she tried to be a star\nTony always tended bar\nAcross the crowded floor, they worked from 8 til 4\nThey were young and they had each other\nWho could ask for more?~~~~"'
p7
aS'Ebola panic is shit made for idiots to get scared, it is very hard to \nspread, it is not like smallpox or plague, you need to be in contact with \nbody fluids of infected person to get infected. In all this panic this \nyear, only around 1300 people have died, less than 2500 infected, and all \nin those few african countries. Normal flu kills 30.000 people yearly. Only \nfreaky thing about ebola is high death rate, but if it was actually serious \nand easy to spread, we would already have a world wide pandemic with \nmillions dead. So chill out, they just wanna scare you into submission.'

aS"Just a thought ...\nSo as we are sitting around on Saturday Night... Notice this outrageous \nline up on TNT Network...1300- The Da Vinci Code (Packed with Illuminati \nsymbolism), 1600- 2012 (Signs of the end of the world as we know it with \nnatural disaster), 1900- War of the Worlds (again signs of the end of the \nworld as we know it with alien invasion), 2130- Contagion ( Signs of the \napocalyptic world to come with the break out of an infectious disease, 0000 \n- Replaying the Da Vinci Code. Now I post this because you don't have to be \nan gung ho conspiracist to see that this is absolutely outrageous. As you \nwatch this movie you can see so many comparisons between the R-naught \nnumber (later in the movie identified as MEV-1) and the current EBOLA \nOUTBREAK. Look just watch the trailer below, it is only a little over 2 \nminutes long. But if you want to just catch the main reason for this \npost... Fast forward to 1:36 of the trailer- here you will find the \ntruth..... then again at 2:00- here you will find the expert advice despite \nwhat you are being told by the CDC. Just a food for thought... God Bless!"

p13
aS'Lol I like how in the 1:27 map pretty much all of Russia is contagion-free.'
p14
aS"Obviously no one here understands epidemiology , this movie (it would \nbehoove the conspiracy theorists to watch ) is a worse case scenario and \nit's not percentages that you should look at it's the R'O' pronounced r-not \nthe exponential rate of transmission ....the blaming and misinterpretation \nof information and more disconcerting is the politicization to cast \naspersions on government and health agencies borders on the ridiculous "
p15
aS"Nooo we are all going to die from Bird Flu.  Oops I mean Swine flu.  Oops I \nmean SARS.  Ooops I mean Ebola.  Holy shit people stop falling for the \nmedia hype.  You know how many people have died from Ebola in 1st world \ncountries so far?  0...  It's a very serious problem in Africa.  And I feel \nvery bad for them.  But use your brains a little bit.  Eventually something \nwill come a long, but it's not Ebola."
p16
aS"Im sorry but if a disease spread this rapidly and killed within days then \nit wouldn't be able to infect the whole planet little own and small town. \n\nMost governments are stupid but that doesn't mean they're not smart."

p40
aS'Ebola ! '
p41
aS'This shit is really happening..'
p42
aS"A movie made 3 years earlier could have told use of whats to come with \nEbola. In the movie THE KNOWING (2009) their was a strange TV clip of a off \nshore oil rig caught on fire in the gulf of mexico. It was only a 15 second \nclip  Gulf oil spill (2010). There also was a tv movie  Oil Storm that \naired on June 5th 2005 on FX about An oil Crisis where a hurricane hit Port \nFourchon LA and wiped out the US's oil supply also making a direct hit to \nNew Orleans. Hurricane Katrina just about 3 months later. I am no \nconspiracy theorist but  I am sure there are more movies out that have some \nkind of eerie prediction of whats going to happen in real life!  I think \nthe government is making these movies to tell us what kind of epidemic or \ndisaster they are going to plan in the future. It might be a little out \nthere. It even sounds crazy to me! "

p47
aS'Ebola is spread by any fluids from victims, and those victims spread \nvarious fluids around very effectively. One doctor commented that "all they \ndo is spread fluids....." \nThink about where those fluids could end up, the average sneeze sends \ndroplets more than six metres. '

p56
aS'Ebola is just the beginning. Ebola has been around since at least the mid \n70s. Ebola is small potatoes compared to the next virus and the next one \nafter that, and so on, that comes around. Once Ebola or rabies or some \nother virus/bacterium with a high case fatality rate (CFR) mutates and \nbecomes airborne, we will all be in big trouble. Its not a nuclear bomb \nfrom ISIS/Al Qaeda we should concern ourselves with. Its the smallest \nmicrobes that may doom the human race.'

aS'Ebola!! This movie is real!! \n\nMan in Texas brought Ebola to America and has come in contact with hundreds \nof people 20-25 of them known and in custody of the government \nEbola comes from bats just like in this movie,\n\nLook into it. '

aS'The stock of Tekmira Pharma began to surge in 2011 as this film was being \nreleased. It has now gone from about $1 per share to over $24 today. They \nare the maker of an experimental Ebola vaccine. The research began 3 years \nago. The strange thing is that many of the largest shareholders are \ngovernment officials according to SEC filings. This begs the question, was \nthis whole thing planned?'

p82
aS'The biggest contagion/epidemic in the human history was caused by flu \nvaccines in 1918 - 50,000,000 people all of the world died from a bird flu \nwhich was in the shot. Spanish flu. Vaccinations are the best! Get ready! \nCorporations need you to be scared and stupid.'
