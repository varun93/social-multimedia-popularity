S'Twilight will always be amazing '
p1
aS"Never thought I'd live in a world were vampires are less manly than ponies"
p2
aS'I kinda don\'t get twilight because its like your obsessed with food such as \nblood for vampires like wtf all the bad guys want is blood their "food"'
p3
aS"Reading the book right now... I'm so late. xD"
p4
aS'Stephenie meyer should have won the noble prize for litertarue, nothing can \ncompare to the literaturary brilliance that these books have. Screw j.k \nRowling!'
p5
aS'Boooooooooooooooooooooooooo '
p6
aS'I admit, the books are way better.'
p7
aS'i can\'t watch this without laughing because there are too many parodies \nmade... especially the "say it. say it out loud" HAHAHAHA'
p8
aS'when after school specials mix with heart throb teen emotions plus vampires \nyou get twilight. A seemingly cheesy yet kind of smoothly directed movie. \nForget about the books for a second and look at it through a movie goers \neyes, the first one was actually pretty cool, Fresh and new. A movie \nstarring the dude who died in potter, Too bad the writer shat all over \nherself instantly making the others into an ultra queerbo movie saga \n....nuff said.'
p9
aS"I loved these books, the movies, they had a great impact on me.  Harry \nPotter, love that too, great books and even better movies.  The whole Harry \nPotter and Twilight war is ridiculous. I'm kind proud to be on the side of \nboth, one of the few who can appreciate a good story and leave it at that. \n None of these stories were written to be better than anything, they only \nbelong to those who enjoy them.  Anyone who tells me I shouldnt like \nTwilight, or why Harry Potter or whatever story is better, has no grasp on \nthis concept."
p10
aS"I couldn't get into this series..there are too many things that are just \nwrong with it and made it so shitty. My opinion."
p11
aS'Edward is so hot when he is cold! :)'
p12
aS'Twilight sucks'
p13
aS"OK,here is my message to all retarded people who say Twilight sucks. \nYEAH,THE MOVIES DO. BUT THE BOOKS ARE SO FREAKING AWESOME! So don't judge \nthe whole series based on retarded movies. And all of you haters are \nretarded. Get the fuck out of here if you don't like it,and stop spreading \nthe hate,idiotic retarded people."
p14
aS'Top ten worst movies of all time #1\nThe twilight saga\nAight where do I even begin? I remember being forced to watch the first in \nthe series and I wanted to stab my eyes out with a spoon from boredom. \nStephanie Meyer successfully destroyed thousands of years of myth and lore \nwith her books. Vampires are NOT cute and cuddly. They CAN NOT walk around \nduring the day time. They COULDNT care less about the human race. \nWerewolves have to wait for a full moon, they CANNOT just change whenever \nthe hell they want especially during the day time\n\nUgh no just no'
p15
aS'Looking at it now, i realize how bad it really was. The books were awesome \nthough.'
p16
aS'Twilight is unfogetable...'
p17
aS'Threaten the Harry Potter dynasty? I very much think not! Doctor Who and My \nLittle Pony have bigger cult followings than this bullshit!'
p18
aS"stop comparing HARRY POTTER with this stupid love story.. and don't say i'm \nanother hater that didn't watch the film.. i watched the first one and \nswitched it off before the end it's soo boring.. it literally is a waste of \ntime ..and twilight is nothing infront of harry potter.. didn't even sell \nHALF of what harry potter sold"
p19
aS'Based on this trailer i have come to a conclusion of the movie please tell \nme if im accurate.\n\nVisual Quality: about as good as a popular comedy youtube channal.\n\nStory: generic boring love story with "action" based on the flat and forced \nlines in the trailer entirely.\n\nMain character: generc girl whos only personality trait is "this cant be \nhappening!!!! I choose you! Derp!"\n\nVampire love interest: generic "good guy" duchebag.\n\nwerewolf love interest: generic "bad boy" duchebag.\n\nOriginality: aside from the vampire wherewolf love triangle dynamic zero.\n\nInspiration: waterd down copy past of a book.'
p20
aS'Nice'
p21
aS'love twilght and the movies'
p22
aS"I'd rather watch a donkey take a big poopy than watch this movie."
p23
aS"Twilight is a stupid love story with an idiotic weak main character. \nSereiously, Bella jumps of cliffs to see hallucinations of Edward after he \nDUMPS her, and then she FORGIVES him! \nDon't you dare ever compare this complete GARBAGE--the books and the \nmovies--to Harry Potter in any way. \nHarry potter is a masterpiece. It has strong characters, lots, lots, and \nlots of character development, humor, and a lot more. And it is not made up \nof idiotic romance like twilight is.\nThe trailer was not the only miss, the whole franchise was a total MISS"
p24
aS'anyone watching this in 2014 ??? no ok...'
p25
aS'The blonde guy , oh right you know what your talking about , his name is \njames lol'

p32
aS'whats the song called in the beginning??'
p33
aS'So this chick moves to a place named after the common utensil we use. What \nnext Spoons, Michigan? Knives, Arkansas? Lol and then falls in love with a \npale dude with a constipated look on his face who also comes off more as a \nblood junkie that happens to sparkle in the sunlight than an actual \nvampire.'
p34
aS"I give it a hit I'm now in love with this film ... And Edward Collins "
p35
aS'i read that book'

p38
aS'best movie ever if you dont know kristen stewart :))'
p39
aS'You cannot compare harry potter with twilight EVER'
p40
aS"most people that hate twilight haven't even seen the movies..they just \nlisten to other haters and cause of the''monkey see monkey do'' fact they \nbecome just another mindless hater...the movie is very good..i didn't liked \nthe New Moon that much and took me a while before watching the rest of the \nsaga...i saw breaking dawn part 1 in the army before a year(i served \nspecial forces as a paratrooper btw)and that night we were like 50-60 guys \nwatching it and everyone liked it,even guys that made fun of it in the \nbeginning..anyway my point is that people hate this movie mostly for no \nreason,or because it's cool making fun of it because some other idiots \ndo,or just because they want to be ''that'' guy..."
p41
aS"Idk why all the hate -.. I'd like to see You's act^"
p42
aS'Exuuussseee me, Harry Potter is a billion times better than this pathetic \nexcuse for a story. These books were a waste of paper. Think of the poor \ntrees who were used for this crap.'
p43
aS'I think it should be remade the book is sooo goodd i mean books will always \nbe better than movies but come on they could have done soo much better on \nthe first one!! '
p44
aS'Why compare HP and twilight two completely different things they are both \nreally good'
p45
aS'kristen stewart having emotions? Really?'
p46
aS"A lot of people hating on twilight haven't even watched the movie, let \nalone read it. I didn't love it, but at least I tried it and some parts \nwere really good. If you hate it why did you take the time to search up the \ntrailer...?"
