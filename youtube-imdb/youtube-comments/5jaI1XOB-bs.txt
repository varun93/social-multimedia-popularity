aS'Really Amazing Movie ! .. So many people hate this movie, but i guess u \nhave to be "old enough" and know what u are watching. Darren Aronofsky did \na really good job making this and Natalie Portman won an oscar for best \nactress in 2011.. Its scary, its dark, its different, its a masterpiece. \nWell i loved it'

p40
aS"This movie was shot in Super 16 and it's beautiful film look closes the \nargument of why 24 fps will always be superior to 30+ fps video look. It's \nlike film looks carefully handmade, while video looks cheap and mass \nproduced."

p46
aS'Best movie ever!'
p47
aS"I didn't understand any of that. :/"
p48
aS"I read that professional ballet dancers make somewhere around 30-35k a \nyear. Why do they get paid so little? They train their whole lives, push \ntheir bodies to the brink of limitation, and have to be perfect and elegant \nwhile performing in front of n audience. You would think they would at \nleast make 100k. I know people will say they are doing what they love but, \ndamn, that's no money at all. You might as well work a office job and make \nlike 50k or something. I would be pissed if I was a ballerina and people \nlike Kim K makes millions while doing absolutely nothing!"
p49
aS'One of the best trailers ever.'
p50
aS"Ok, to everyone who asks its a feather she pulls out of her back and I'm \npretty sure it's Nina's hallucination. \n"

p62
aS'I have to say, that I was wrong. Wrong for waiting so long to see this \ngreat film, and I really thought that there was some obvious symbolism \ngoing on, but it was really a ruse. There are some great transformations \nand deceptions, as well as the mixing of real and imaginary happenings, \nthat are not always clear which are which. \n\nThere are also some very sexy scenesAlso, one of the most heightened and \nin the moment masturbation scenes. Nicely done!'

aS"i've had such a complicated experience with my dear friend, ballet...      \ni really want to watch this film but i'm very scared to watch it.\nballet is so powerful- when i lost the passion, it overpowered me like a \nkind of monster.  \nWow."
p77
aS"Everytime that I watch this movie is shocking and exciting like the first \ntime. Darren Aranofsky made a incredible masterpiece, Clint Mansell brought \nthe wonderful music of Tchaikovsky and Natalie's performance was \namazing, captivating... something wonderful that I can hardly describe. \nThis is one of the best movies ever, ALL IS PERFECT, ALL!

O_o I didn't just get it, like wtf was going om and the \nend was like WTF IS HAPPENING! WASTED MY FUCKING TIME WATCHING IT \nUUUGGHHHH!"
p86
aS"This film, in my opinion, is one of the greatest movies of all time. Darren \nAronofsky DEFINITELY hit a home run with this. In fact, this one is only \nthe 3rd psychological thriller I've seen, first being SILENCE OF THE LAMBS \nand the second being SHUTTER ISLAND. I'm thrilled how this film can't be \nconsidered an art film due to its thick, detailed plot. Also, it's one of \nthe scariest horror films I've seen since THE CONJURING, and that was \nabsolutely terrifying. Who knew Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis could \nportray such amazing characters. Obviously no one else could play them. \n\nActually, because of their performances in BLACK SWAN, I wrote two \ncharacters for them to play in my film I'm writing. There will be a video \nabout it on my channel in a while."
