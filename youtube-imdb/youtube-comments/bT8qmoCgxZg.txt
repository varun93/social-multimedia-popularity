I understand the need to \nappeal to a western audience but seriously, minorities in america and \naround the world have no problem watching superhero movies with a white \ncast and/or lead.  Maybe white people need to be able to see past their own \ncolor and stop being spoiled'

p83
aS'um, did anyone else think of Nico di Angelo when they saw the kid?'
p84
aS'will Silver Samurai be in this?'
p85
aS"So from here, it can go one of two ways. Either a) it will be better than \nWreck it Ralph (and Wreck it Ralph was good)...or...b) I will end up \ndisliking it like I did Frozen (really, at the VERY LEAST, Disney, I'm \nbegging you, PLEASE don't involve SINGING!)\nIf it doesn't have random singing (strategic singing that makes sense, is a \nwhole other different matter), and sticks to the seriousness/humor of the \nplot instead of crony songs, I can already guess there's gonna be some \ncompetition between this and HTTYD2. Maybe it won't be better than HTTYD or \nRise of the Guardians, but it will probably be good enough to compete \nagainst HTTYD2.\n\nOn that note, for some unknown reason, when I first saw the trailer, the \nfirst thing that it reminded me of was HTTYD. Am I the only one?"

p92
aS"*Genius Kid* \n*Sassy Girl with Bad Attitude* \n*Doopy/High Dumb Guy* \n*Single Mom Don't need no Man* \n*Generic Villain* \n*Huge Audience That Will Pay for This Recycled Shit* "
