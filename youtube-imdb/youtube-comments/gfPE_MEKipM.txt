S'Why do people hate Kristen Stewart so much? Cause of ignorant memes on the \ninternet?\nHonestly I think she is incredibly beautiful. And this movie is alot better \nthan what this trailer makes it look like.'
p1
aS'One of the most charming coming-out-of-age romances ever. But the trailer \nis unthankfull. I would have never watched the movie if I had seen the \ntrailer before\n'
p2
aS"They're trying to advertise it like a mainstream american comedy. \nAdventureland's nothing like that. It's in a category of it's own. Great \nmovie."

aS'\n\n\n'
p4
aS'Kennywood!'
p5
aS'The twilight girl actually looks pretty hot in this '
p6
aS"Guys,please take my advice,i watched the movie before the \ntrailer,please,please screw the trailer,they totally made it look bad. If i \nknew who Kristen Stewart was before the movie i would probably just skip \nthe movie,just recently i found out about Twilight. Her acting in this \nmovie was incredible,sure i think twilight sucks,but it's the \nmovie,not  Kristen Stewart,give it a shot (I'm a guy btw and i adored the \nmovie)!"
p7
aS"not a good movie. why?\n1/ its not very 80s though it claims to be 1987\n2/ immature movie with a predicable plot(note i am referring to movie not \ncharacters in it who are free to be all that)\n3/pretentious and elitist\n4/ hypocritical, stereotypical,  and irrational, in its(movie's) attitude \nand judgment on some characters\nlast three point feed of each other\n\n\n "
