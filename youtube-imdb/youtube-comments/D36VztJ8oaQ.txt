p2
aS'Why did they have to make the captain look like a wimp at the end;kind of \nspoilt it.They could have had him saying something like.."What a f**k**g \nday I\'ve had"or something!It wasn\'t all true anyway I understand.'
p3
aS'USAIN BOLT BECAME A PIRATE!??! AND SKINNY TOO!'
p4
aS"This movie IN NO WAY represents the truth of those events according to \nseveral real crew members on this ship.  Captain Phillips is being hailed a \nhero when according to the crew he was an arrogant a s s hole who ignored \nemails from his superiors that pirates were boarding ships and taking over \nin the area.  Captain Phillips is also being called a hero for trading \nhimself as a hostage instead of the crew when in fact he did no such \nthing.  Just another POS Hollywood movie producers making money off of a \nPOS human being's point of OPINION against the real facts. Why not do a \nmovie based on REAL EVENTS instead of this kind of garbage? "
p5
aS"It was good but pointless, why the fuck do Americans make such a big \nfucking deal over small things, the way he cried at the end i was like.... \noh really, are you shitting me.....  He got kidnapped but it's not like the \ntortured him and cut his limbs off...... and all the men hiding on the \nship..... if that was Russians and not Americans those Africans would have \nbeen dead 5 min before they got on the ship. The movie was good but the \nwhole point was just stupid, people get kidnapped and shot all the time, \nwhy was this event so special? "

p20
aS'Some minor issues, first of the Pirates have no subtitles when they speak \nEnglish, their english is not very clear so it is extremely hard to \nunderstand what they are saying, I could have done without the shaky cam, I \nthink it took away from the action sequences rather than add more realism \nand lastly I think I film drags in the second half, they could have easily \nskimmed of 30 mins, I feel the film would have been more re-watchable that \nway. Still an awesome movie though.'

A genuine look at the whole picture would make - um, I \ndon\'t know - an interesting movie, don\'t you think? Problem is that would \nhurt a simple hollywood narrative which is easy for an average viewer to \ndigest. I bet this one will end with stars & stripes, Hanks walking with \nbrave Seals though crowds cheering and shouting "USA! USA!"'
