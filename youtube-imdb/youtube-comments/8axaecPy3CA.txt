aS"I think Rupert Grint is such an underrated actor. Just because he's not the \nmost outgoing person in interviews or just because he doesn't stand out \namong his Potter co-stars by working on many projects, that doesn't mean \nhe's not great. On the contrary, all his performances are stunning. I \nremember the fighting scene with Harry in the DH part 1, where his acting \nskills totaly blew me away and yet here he's the funniest guy ever. Keep \ngoing, you have all my support, dear Rupert!!"
