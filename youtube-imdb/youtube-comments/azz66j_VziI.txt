S'What is the music starting at :29 seconds???'
p1
aS'Great movie this and the original are prob my favorite slashers'
p2
aS'I love Elijah wood, from his days from lord of rings I guess I might just \nwatch this movie'
p3
aS"That's why you don't mess with his ring bitches."
p4
aS"Watched this the other day. One of the better remakes I have seen in \nawhile. I like it when they add new things. And don't do a shot for shot \nremake. I recommend this one."
p5
aS"Stupid ass retarded movie can't believe I wasted my time watching this \nmovie. "
p6
aS'visually striking and gore a plenty and with stylish effects, but not as \npowerful as the original,still a great watch'
p7
aS'Really innovative, gripping & quite shocking at times.\n\nBut ... both the gore scenes and the POV perspective become repetitive \nafter a while. I also think the film should have developed more emotional / \npsychological depth.'
p8
aS'Maniac Official Trailer #2 (2013) - Elijah Wood Movie HD'
p9
aS'I saw the remake of Maniac, a very good film that has managed to find the \natmosphere of the first film.'
p10
aS"If you like horror movies, I recommend the new Maniac starring Elijah Wood. \nIt totally exudes 80's film-making sensibilities, but is all shot first \nperson, which is really interesting. It's On Demand or in select theaters \nnow."
p11
aS'Now this is a horror film!'
p12

p42
aS'Damn... I think someone forgot to drop the ring in the lava... You were \nsupposed to destroy Sauron, not become him!! Oh the humanity.. (sobs....)'
p43
aS'I was saying the same thing....he easily fits in as Sinister!'
p44
aS'I have to see this Elijah/frodo playing a killer awesome'
p45
aS'well that\'s what happends when people call you "oh Frodo" for the last ten \nyears :D'

p59
aS'What?'
p60
aS"I don't know why I'm so intrigued. Maybe because Elijah Wood is always such \na pansy little boo and to see him play a murderer would be interesting. I \nhate horror, but I will watch this."

p62
aS'PTS from walking to Mordor and back.'
