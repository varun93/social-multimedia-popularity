S"If they release a fast 8 i actually don't think i would watch it without \nPaul Walker....He sorta has been there since the beginning and it just \nwon't feel the same without him in the movie."
p1
aS'1:41 shout out to Dillon Francis and DJ Snake *GET LOW*'
p2
aS'As 25-30% of this movie was shot with Paul most of these glamour shots are \nnot him but his brothers with cgi rendering and digital voice dubbing \nsimilar to what was done in Tron Legacy. With that said a lot of Paul in \nthis trailer isnt him at all. Get used to it fans. I think the only real \nshots of him were in the beginning, and that glamour shot with Vin. \nEverything else is body doubles. I think the shot at 2:13 is most \ndefinitely a rendered double.'
p3
aS"*R.I.P Paul Walker.*\n\nThis movie wont be the same without you, if there are any upcoming movies \nof the Fast and Furious franchise... it will be a shame without you... :'(\n\n\nI will definitely designing something for you (tribute)"
p4
aS"Pause at 1:31 and you can see its not Paul Walker \n#RIPPaulWalker  We all miss you :'("
p5
aS'I hope this one is better than the last 2'
p6
aS'is the luckas black in the movie???'
p7
aS'Does... Does anyone have a cigarette?  '
p8
aS'whats the sing used in this trailer?'
p9
aS'Does The Rock lose his arm?'
p10
aS'Iam happy cause they found an actor that looks like *Paul Walker*.\nBut is not the same think without him... :S\n*#RestsInPeace*'
p11
aS'i swear the rock might as well be jesus'
p12
aS'I can\'t count how many times I just said \'WHHAAAAAAAT??!?!?!?!"'
p13
aS'*Paul Walkers acting looks stiff and lifeless*'
p14
aS"I love the series! I have the box set and have probably watched all the \nmovies at least 3-4 times but I really don't like the look of this trailer \nand I know that some bits are set in Japan but what's with the weird asian \nmusic at the end. "
p15
aS'RIP Paul...  guess we get to go for one last ride...'
p16
aS"What's next in the story another shaw gets revenge? XD "
p17
aS"You know what would be really cool, that if they bring back the villain \nfrom 2 fast 2 furious, he gets out of jail and is some how working with \nJason Statham. The guy even said I'll be seeing you soon to Paul and \nTyrese."
p18
aS"Haha sick trailer, this is what I want in this movie. Impossible stunts \nthat are just too crazy to even consider putting in a movie. \nAlso it's really weird watching Paul Walker knowing what happened to him, \nwhat a sad loss."
p19
aS"Where's street racing in the new fast n furious movies? the movies are not \nas they used to be like in the old ones. this is more like an action movie \nthen a car movie :'("
p20
aS'So, do we get to see who won the race at the end of Tokyo Drift?'
p21
aS'Fast and furious 7 '
p22
aS'Les compartimos el trailer de la pelcula Fast & Furious 7 esperamos que lo \ndisfruten.'
p23
aS"CAN'T WAIT FOR THE MOVIE NOW!"
p24
aS'10 movies later and you\'re still gonna hear "ready for one last ride?"'
p25
aS"Wait... Hang on minute! Paul Walker died didn't he? I read it in the \npapers! So how can he be in this new film? I'm confused..."
p26
aS'1:42 song plz'
p27
aS"I know it's harsh to say but I hope Brian (PW) dies in the franchise just \nso that they can pay homage for Paul rather than getting someone else to \nput on his role."
p28
aS'Paul Walker? How? How is he in the film? Im anxious '
p29
aS'#RIPPaulWalker 1:31 you cant ist not Paul :c'
p30
aS'Dammit let the Paul rest on the other side of this world, think what you \nwould like to hear after death the cryes tieres and screams of scare, or \nthe joy, good words which comes out with a smile on a face, which would \nmake youself a smile that your work was worthed... sure he watching us all \nbut please stop crying because all those cryes distract him  from his work \nout there. The FF7 will be a hit thats for sure, but it wont be that hit \nwhen in cinemas will be hearing the tires not the applause.'
p31
aS"oh chill the fuck out guys, he died. I'm sure he wouldnt want everyone \ngoing rip rip rip rip rip."
p32
aS"The trailer isn't a trailer. It is just a scene from the movie. But it \nlooks good!"
p33
aS'0:43 Tony Jaa :)'
p34
aS'i honestly think the trailer shows a bit too much at the cliff \nscene..giving away too much could ruin the movie:('
p35
aS'where is lucas black!'
p36
aS'Music end? anyone know?'
p37
aS"Where's the redneck guy from Tokyo Drift?"
p38
aS"The fact that Jason Statham plays in it makes it 10 times more badass. I'm \ndefenitely watching this shit."
p39
aS'KURT RUSSELL!!!!!'
p40
aS'Cars jumping out of the Plane seems to be copied from the Dark Knight \nRises. '
p41
aS"First trailer roars in for Fast & Furious 7\nThe first trailer for Fast & Furious 7 has exploded online in spectacular \nfashion, and its every bit as deliriously OTT as you could have hoped for\n\nThe new trailer kicks things off with a ludicrously fun action sequence in \nwhich Vin Diesels crew parachute some souped-up automobiles out of a \nplane, before taking down a heavily-armoured truck.\n\nThen were introduced to Jason Stathams big bad, all snarled cockney \nthreats and villainous swagger. He also seems like hes going to be good \nfun.\nLooks like Furious 7 (as it's to be called in the US; still Fast & Furious \n7 in the UK) is all set to be 2015s most enjoyable actioner, while there a \ncouple of nice nods to the late Paul Walker, including a poignant reference \nto one last ride.\n\nDirected by James Wan and co-starring Kurt Russell, Dwayne Johnson and \nMichelle Rodriguez, Furious 7 will open in the UK on 3 April 2015."
p42
aS'statham vs. diesel, very interesting!!!'
p43
aS'2:13 look VERY CLOSELY, Sean from tokyo drift gets out the car!'
p44
aS'If this means that brian does not die in this movie ,which is quite visible \n,then we are up for a big ass FF!!!'
p45
aS'Remember when Fast and the Furious was about cars and streetracing?'
p46
aS'1:40 Any one knows the music name?'
p47
aS"I think that some shots with Paul Walker are CGI because of his death. I \nmay be wrong but that is what I've heard. "
p48
aS'Paul walker died in the middle of makin the film, how are they gonna show \nthe rest of it?'
p49
aS"I just hope this one plays in Tokyo, even if the setting in the trailer \ndoesn't look like tokyo :/"
p50
aS'I thought gisele died?'
p51
aS'Is it me or does the car at 2:01 look like the concept version of the new \nMitsubishi 3000gt! And this could be a small preview of it. Or does some \nelse know what kind of car it is? I mean go on Google and type in 3000gt \nconcept and it looks very similar! To me I think it is! '
p52
aS'This movie better have the fantasy genre included.\nDon\'t forget these are the same guys that said that they can:\n1. Jump, catch a person mid-air, crash into a windshield and walk it off \nlike it\'s daily routine.\n2. Keep up with a plane with cars.\n3. Said they can hold a carrier-plane down with cars!\nand lastly,\n4. Stoping the cars in 2 sec without any effort after "holding down" a \nmoving plane '

p56
aS'The amount of bullshit in there XD'
p57
aS"The only Fast and Furious I liked was the fourth one. This one looks the \nsame old commercial drama but Jason Statham's edition should save it."
p58
aS'Damn so there will be The Rock vs Jason Statham and Vin  vs Jason Statham \nfight.\n\nI hope they shot a early fight scene with Paul vs Jason Statham. He hardly \ngets any of the good fights. '
p59
aS"I love this trailer! I don't want it to be one last ride, But if Fast 8 \ncomes I would watch it but with Paul Walker not being alive anymore it \nwould be hard to watch Fast 7 and 8."

aS"This film is going to be soo good in honoring paul walkers legacy and this \nreally marks what he achieved and of course his co stars, i would like to \nthink that this is going to be the last fast and furious, don't get me \nwrong i would love to see another one but i don't  see how this can \ncontinue without him unless his brothers are apart of the franchise now \nwhich i hope to god they are "
