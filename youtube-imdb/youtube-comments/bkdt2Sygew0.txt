p2
aS'Netflix has it...'
p3
aS'Someone recommend me more movies like "EXAM" please??? I like mind games \nmovies..'
p4
aS'@kuntula25 watch "nine dead" it\'s a GREAT psychological thriller very \nsimilar to this film. Try it! I hope you like it.'
p5
aS'I was hoping Colin Salmon would pop up after eighty minutes and say "Um, \nright guys. Whilst you have been pissing on your exam scripts and smashing \nup the lighting the actual question was \'Define risk in project \nmanagement\'... If you don\'t hear from us in a fortnight then please assume \nyour application has been unsuccessful."'
p6
aS'Iove this movie!!! I just watched it...again cuz I watched it before :P The \nend was awesome I didnt see it coming! O.o'
p7
aS"i disagree, it's a brilliant trailer"
p8
aS'Not only this, but the film does nothing other than give one a very \nunpleasant feeling in the pit of their stomach, emotionally, without any \nreal resolution of this feeling or release of the strong emotions horror \nand suspense films tend to evoke. It kind of brings you down mentally so \nthat one can fester uncomfortably, and then fails to address that tension, \npartly because the actors are bad and partly because the narrative itself \nis lacking in direct comment on its own conflicts.'
p9
aS'The answer is....just watch the movie :)'
p10
aS'there is no question '
p11
aS'Who can write me in private more moves like "saw" Exam" \'cube" ?'
p12
aS'its excellent but you will feel like a moron when you get to the end. i \nshowed this to about 20 people and all of them were tricked '
p13
aS"That's not all they were looking for in a candidate. The rules in place \nhelped weed out those who wouldn't/couldn't live up to the other qualities \nthey were looking for."
p14
aS'@Ln192 How did you end up paying 60 dollars for a movie lol :P '
p15
aS'Such a fucking terrible movie'
p16
aS'the 8 people represent the most common behavior types, one idea of the \nmovie is perhaps the thinking and working as a unit can make us find the \nresult we looking for at a workplace. of course in the movie is about \nfinding the best answer/person to take up the responsibility as a leader in \na pharmaceutical company, but like at any company the idea is what will u \nmake (and how?)to find best solutions for your company in any situation. '
p17
aS'Watched this film...AWESOME!!!! xD'
p18
aS'As one who was interested from the exclamations of others, take my word and \nwatch a better film that might change your view on the world. I highly \nrecommend A Separation, which I recently watched. It will make you feel as \nterrible, but in a way that will make you a better person at the end of it. '
p19

p31
aS'A typical Day of school... '
p32
aS'The beauty of the movie wasn\'t about the complexity of the question, it was \nabout the natural ignorance of us all to small simple details such as that. \nHow far will the human imagination stretch in order to present ourselves \nthe question (or rather the answer). P.S: From the "company\'s" point of \nview: The attention to details and the relief of stress from taking such a \nvital exam, are the desired qualities of the candidates. '
p33
aS'vi el trailer, me basta con eso....para qu ver la pelicula?? los que hacen \nlos trailers son unos genios ajjajaja '

p44
aS'I like to watch the trailer after I ve seen the movie Lol'
p45
aS'Intresting movie.. :)'
p46
aS'Exactly. The corporation was looking for a candidate with a specific type \nof mindset and personality. Everything about the final exam would induce \nsituations and stresses that would show which candidate possessed those \ntraits they were looking for. The simplicity of the question was definitely \na necessary component to the whole thing.'

p58
aS'This movie <3'
p59
aS"Such a terrible film. No one should pay the 4 dollars youtube is going to \ncharge you to watch this film. The actors were all really bad, it was \nreally camp, and, like others have said, the film's dialogue often sets up \na logical narrative which it struggles to maintain. There is lots in this \nfilm which doesn't make any sense once the final pieces are laid. It is not \nparticularly inspiring, nor are the twists terribly unexpected."
p60
aS'This is definitely my favourite movie of all time :D'
