p59
aS'Whats up with that female mob in end? I was like wtf ..'
p60
aS"I didn't get this movie. The kid Robbie was a weird ass kid, random shit \nhappened, and a random ending with no explanation of the army of possessed \nchicks. Somebody explain. I watched this movie like 5 times and I'm still \nconfused"
p61
aS"The trouble is it's the same crap they did in all the other movies, and \nwasn't the first born baby ment to be taken to hell or something, why has \nhe suddenly come back older.  I wouldn't mind it, but you can basically \ntell the story without watching this stuff, Someone films cuz they hear \nsome crazy stuff at night and want to prove they arn't nuts, then someone \nsays they don't belive in it and that supposedly makes 'IT' mad, then some \nweird stuff gets film, mostly at 12am onward then we get a bit where the \nkid stands and stares at protaganist for over two hours or disappears \ndownstairs for hours.  Then we get the bed sheet whipped off moment oo like \nthat hasn't been done before, then the dragging along the floor into a room \nand door slams with them screaming ooo so scary. Then you get the friend \nwho believes but gets freeked out by the end and runs for the hills and \nfinally we get the death scenes, which is a massive force like something \nfrom Starwars shoots them across the room and they die instantly or their \nneck/back is broken and the demon that has possessed the protaganist walks \noff into the night never to be seen again. UNLESS THEY MAKE ANOTHER MOVIE!! \nWhich they almost certainly will because there are still people out there \nthat watch this tripe."
