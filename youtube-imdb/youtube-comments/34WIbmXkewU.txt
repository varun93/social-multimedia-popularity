S"A very overrated movie. It's a fine film, familiar tropes seen a million \ntimes in Hollywood movies, my guess is people fawn over it exactly because \nit's not Hollywood, it's French, so you have an alibi for liking a \nsaccharine sentimental movie."

aS"Magical film. I don't care if people think this movie is clich. What \nmatters is that this movie gave me feelings that not many things ever have. \nIf you haven't watch this, get on it! Also Omar Sy is unbelievably good!"
p9
aS'I\'ve seen a lot of movies in my years.  Some multi-million-dollar, \nbig-budget, effects-filled nightmares that pull away at all your senses. \n It\'s been a long time since I\'ve viewed a movie about real, human, \nfeelings, and a genuine respect and love displayed between two people from \ncompletely different worlds.  I mean an unexpected deep dive into feelings \nthat made me laugh out loud, and embrace it almost from the beginning.  The \ncherry on top is that it\'s a French film with subtitles and I absolutely \nhate those.  Not this one.  This film, "The Intouchables" is in my Top 10 \nfor my most favorite films....EVER.  If you\'ve never seen it, don\'t take my \nword for it.  View it yourself and find out why it impacted me so.'
