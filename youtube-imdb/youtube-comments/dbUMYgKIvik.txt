aS'MOVIE CAME OUT AUGUST 22, 2014:\nPOSSESSION OF MICHAEL KING\n\nIn the movie The Possession Of Michael King,\nMichael King (Shane Johnson) doesnt believe\nin God or the Devil. Following the sudden death\nof his wife, Michael decides to make his next film\nabout the search for the existence of the supernatural,\nmaking himself the center of the experiment  allowing demonologists, \nnecromancers, and various\npractitioners of the occult to try the deepest\nand darkest spells and rituals they can find on him \nin the hopes that when they fail, hell once and for\nall have proof that religion, spiritualism, and the\nparanormal are nothing more than myth.\n\nBut something does happen.\nAn evil and horrifying force has taken over\nMichael King. And it will not let him go.'
p5
aS'nuh uh'
p6
aS"Yes. Let's summon a demon from darkest depths of hell. \nBy drawing the Alien Ant Form symbol on his chest"
p7
aS'Actually, Lucifer, which is a Latin Name, was made up by the old Roman \nCatholic church.  The real name of the so called, Prince of Darkness is \nSamyasa, (i am spelling it differently)Who was the Leader of the five \nWatchers who had the duty of taking care of men, a task giving by their \nCreator.  Samyasa, went against The Creator and him and the other four \nwhere cast away from heaven.  The story its pretty long, but informative.  \nNow, this Lucifer was invented so that the story takes another turn.  Be \ncareful what you read and believe,...there is a lot of false stories out \nthere made to confuse and control our minds.  Religion was invented for \nsame reason; If we ALL believe in just God, our Creator, there would not be \nso much division in this world.  That was the plan from beginning, to \ndivide us all....and mission accomplished.'
p8
aS"it's cool because all we see are women  being possessed. I haven't seen a \nmovie where the dude gets super fucked up by a demon"
p9
aS"How come there aren't so many REAL horror movies anymore, with actual \npsychos and none of this boring paranormal bull? "
p10
aS'Another possession movie.. NOPE!'
p11
aS'Be careful what you wish for...you just might get it!'
p12
aS'O K\nin.f h'
p13
aS"Anyone tried streaming this movie? I would really like to watch it but \ncan't seem to find anywhere to stream. Guess I'll just have to rent it!"
p14
aS"finally one of these where it's not the baby, the toddler, or the \nwife/girlfriend"
p15
aS'hes so stupid real stupid fkn stupid. '
p16
aS'Finally a male who is possessed and not a female in a white dress.'
p17
aS'it has possibilities '
p18
aS'This movie is fake.... he is not really a king.'
p19
aS'Here We go again....more supernatural bullshit!'
p20
aS'Just finished watching this movie. If theres a wors that can overpower the \nword lame then tell me because thats how I describe this movie. Waste of \ntime and money'
p21
aS'Watched it last night. \nI will admit, from the route it was taking at first in the movie, it looked \nlike it was gonna be a promising movie. But then, they decided to kill it \nwith cheap, loud jumpscares and the demon stuff was clich. Well actually, \nthe teeth thing was pretty original, but the rest fell flat. Some of the \nscenes reminded me too much of the Exorcist. '
p22
aS'You know if this shit was real it would be militarized... '
p23
aS'just whatch it and suprisily good.'
p24
aS"another stupid story about a father with family and little child, and all \nhe wants to do is to get possessed by evil.  HUH???  No wonder why we had \nthe mother who killed her children by drowning them in her bathtub.  Fake \nstories but promoting stupid people to be irresponsible with what they \ncurrently have in life.  Why don't those dumb a** just kill themselves \nstopping wasting other logically thinking individuals' oxygen and spaces."
p25
aS'0:35 end of movie.'
p26
aS'generic'
p27
aS'YAAWWWWWNNNNNN..'

p30
aS'Omg. This movie looks boring.'
p31
aS"I can't find the movie in Red box anymore? Plus it is not in our Wal-Mart? \nWhat is up with that? Small towns!"
p32
aS"I really liked this movie, yes I know it's another paranormal activity kind \nof movie but I liked those movies and most rip offs but this one is very \ngood too !!!  I recommend it if you are fan of these kind of movies or \nhorror in general !"
p33
aS'I hate found footage movies! Paranormal activity is childish, cliche, so \nnot original and just straight up crap. But this looks original.. With a \nlive action/ found footage mix. I think this might be the horror movie that \nwins back some respect for the genre :D'
p34
aS'Exxxxxxxxxcellllllllent Movie....'
p35
aS'Eh...looks like they over did it...'
p36
aS'I occasionally watch horror movies and I for one kinda actually liked this \none, there comes a time where you just get used to horror movies and that\'s \nwhere the story kicks in. I liked how fast the story progressed, there were \nfew to no dull moments but I gotta admit there were A LOT of jump scares. I \nliked the story, this was my first found footage possession movie (I don\'t \ncount PA as the possession part came way way WAY at the end as oppose to \nthis) so I can\'t really compare it to anyone BUT ALL I GOT TO SAY IS "THIS \nIS 100% BETTER THAN THAT SHITTY ANNABELLE".\n\n\n\n\n\n*SPOILER ALERT*\nI liked the part where he said about the angels were actually the ones \ncausing those static or blocks to prevent him from hearing the devil\'s \nvoices.\n\nAnd did he just finger his sister?'
p37
aS'Warning this movie will open the door to evil so dont watch it.'
p38
aS'I would suggest watching it. I love being scared and this movie did it. \nLots of creepy and intense visuals, I had to look away sometimes. Good use \nof the POV style. '
p39
aS'I wanted ppls opinions on the film, yet I get ppl spouting religious hate \nat each pthef , what fun you all must have '
p40
aS'I wanna see it'
p41
aS'nuh uh'
p42
aS'By far the scariest movie of 2014.'
p43
aS'bad '
p44
aS'Looks pretty good. But I fear nothing.'
p45
aS'All this movie is gonna do is make you a little bit deaf. effing loud \nnoises. '
p46
aS"i'v bean there..."
p47
aS'This movie is bullshit!!'
p48
aS'Can someone tell me the name of the demon of the ants? The name is show in \nthe book very briefly i need to know thanks.'
p49
aS"If you haven't actually seen this movie then don't talk shit about it. One \nof the best horror movies I've seen in a while, scared the absolute crap \nout of me and it isn't a jumpy film. The way the whole film is put \ntogether, the acting, the cinematography, the story line all just make this \nfilm EXTREMELY creepy. \nI feel majority of horror movies are completely the same these days and no \none is coming up with anything new and yes while the story of demonic \npossession has been covered many a time, this movie has a different take, a \nnew idea and it is completely terrifying. "
p50
aS'Ohhh sheet...... '
p51
aS'Sponsored by... the Pope.'
p52
aS"That looks SOooo bad.\nCan't they come up with something original?"
p53
aS"People ask where the new horror movies are at, but...pretty much everything \nhas been done. Possesion , serial killers, haunted houses, demons, asylums, \nhell, psychological thrillers, cgi monsters of every shape and size, it's \nALL BEEN DONE."
p54
aS"Scary as shit I jumped out my seat a few time's lol. Fantastic movie you \ncan't miss out on"
p55
aS'The possession of Michael king is even more scarier that the original \npossession film'
p56
aS'Explain it atheists?'
p57
aS"it's convincing you that it is a horror or paranormal activity movie....but \nit's not..."
p58
aS'Cheap ass low budget bullshit film with a talent less script writer and \neven more talent less "actors". Available on pirate sites... not worth the \ndownload.'
p59
aS"For a B movie this doesn't look half bad."
p60
aS'I mean drunk and high at the same time. I want nachos'
p61
aS"The movie itself isn't that graphic but, the possession is pretty intense. \n\nI especially love the fact that it's a man being possessed and not the \ncliche young girl/woman. "
p62
aS"Looks kinda cheesy but I'm all in for it"
p63
aS"Funny how people tell religious people to stop believing in what they can't \nprove. Yet it is perfectly fine for the scientists they worship to believe \nin Dark matter, and Anti-matter which they cannot prove to exist. \nAlso Atheist scientists have acknowledged the existences of Paranormal \nentities, but say they are made of something other than souls and are \nevolutionary beings of Dark Matter we have yet to learn how to control and \nare not summoned from places like hell, or have anything to do with \nreligion."
p64
aS'Is Michael King Mexican?'
p65
aS'Thinking about watching this :)'
p66
aS'Imagine if it was based on a true story '
p67
aS'Damn good movie and even us "keyboard atheists" (as the other commenter \ncalled us) can enjoy it too! Is there no end to Christians harassing \natheists'
p68
aS'Twas a great movie guys. Just watched it.'
p69
aS'this looks good!'
p70
aS'Enough with "found footage" paranormal movies! I want REAL scary movies \nlike Silence of the Lambs, or the Conjuring, or Orphan. The world doesn\'t \nneed remakes of the same movie over and over again but with different \npeople getting possessed. '
p71
aS'Alguien sabe cuando sale en cines de mexico por favor??? '
p72
aS'Never watch this drunk and high, its fuckin trippy as hell. I fully \nrecommend it :) its cool.'
p73
aS"What's the name of the song at the end of this video?"
p74
aS'Good I like it, different '
p75
aS"Funny. This guy was arguing with me about Demons being fake 2-3 days ago. \nNow I see a trailer of an atheist that wants to prove spiritualism and the \nparanormal are nothing more than a myth, and ends up getting possessed. \nDemons aren't a joke, don't mess with it. I don't give a damn if you're an \natheist or not."
p76
aS"The devil is real. Repent while there is yet time. Do you know where you're \ngoing when you die? Know Jesus, know peace <3"
p77
aS'1:11 just scared the crap out of me.'
p78
aS'Not bad!! a man tapes himself being possessed, the bad thing is that the \ntrailer sells us all the spoilers :/'
p79
aS'NO '
p80
aS'Hahaha someone said keyboard atheist'
p81
aS"I haven't been this excited for a horror flick in YEARS!"
p82
aS'Looks cool..'
p83
aS'This is a real horror!'
p84
aS"I really don't know how they can come up with any new jump scare \ntechniques, like I've seen them all"
p85
aS'!!!!!!!!!!\n\nThe Possession of Michael King Official Trailer #1 (2014) - Shane Johnson \nHorror Movie HD'
p86
aS"I don't understand why this is a horror movie. He wanted to get possessed.. \nso that's what he's experiencing. What's the problem? "
p87
aS"There is an element of truth in this movie. If people play around with \ndarkness, they've opened a can of worms that they can't close on their own \npower. One must sincerely repent and seek God's forgiveness before the evil \nspirit can be successfully expelled. As a side note, the only problem with \nthis movie is that it exaggerates the powers of darkness, but it rightly \nportrays the demon as a powerful, dark, seductive, and sinister force; \nunfortunately, movies like this focus way too much on the Devil and fail to \nshow the goodness, love, and mercy of God for mankind as well as His \nomnipotence over the kingdom of darkness."
p88
aS"If I wasn't on a fortifying regimen of drugs I'd probably find this too \nfrightening to watch."
p89
aS"Ain't this young girl famous, what was her name?"
p90
aS'This is another version of "God is real". Bet this was also sponsored by \nthe church who has the most to gain if it attracts sheep again.'
p91
aS'Mini Review - The Possession of Michael King\n\nWatch this one. Just another possession flick right? Nope. Hard to \nsynopsize too much without revealing plot points, but just know that this \nis a "found footage" flick in the best way. No shaky handheld stuff. The \nfilm follows a film maker that uses multiple cameras. So that gives us \ndifferent angles and legitimate cinematic quality that sets this miles \nahead of your average POV flick. In fact, its very rare that there are 1st \nperson POV shots. Excellent writing. Excellent production, Excellent \nacting. \n\n4.5/5\n\nThe Possession of Michael King Official Trailer #1 (2014) - Shane Johnson \nHorror Movie HD'
