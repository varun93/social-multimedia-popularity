S'how the fuck is kristen stewart "fairer" than charlize they got it \nbackwards lol'
p1
aS'I tried to watch this movie. Really, I did. But it was freaking retarted.'
p2
aS'"You are the fairest, but there are another destine to surpass you"\n......\n....Nope, still can\'t see it. Where?'
p3
aS'Okay this mirror is either blind or stupid if it honestly believes that \nKristen Stewart is hotter than Charlize Theron. '
p4
aS"I love this movie! And not just because Chris Hemsworth is in it. <3 :D. I \nhate all movies when the Prince is the hero because that's how it has \nalways been.you don't have to be a Prince to be a hero!!!!! I love how the \nhuntsman was the hero this time! STILL WAY BETTER THEN THE DISNEY \nVERSION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
p5
aS"I absolutely love this movie and forever will. I just like how dark it is. \nI don't why some people hate it but whatever I guess. "
p6
aS'Im here for Claflin'
p7
aS"Such a disappointment. Horrible story line, confusing \nplot and underdeveloped characters. Kristen Stewart's acting did not \nconvince me (or anyone it seems) and lets not even get into how bad her \ncharacter's development was. Best thing about this movie was Charlize \nTheron, (best performance really) followed by hemsworth, claflin and Bob \nHoskins (hands down). The dwarves were irrelevant, the love triangle was \nconfusing at best and the chemistry between Chris Hemsworth and Kristen was \nnonexistent. Also, whats up with that ending? Does she even know how or \nrather WHO woke her up? Who does she love? The girl kissed who she thought \nwas the prince but was awakened by the huntsman? make up your mind snowy"
p8
aS"I love this movie. Chris Hemsworth is one hellavua actor! Charlize Theron \nis superb! Can't wait for the sequel!"
p9
aS'This was disappointing! Charlize Theron made it watchable. '
p10
aS'went to see this,nope! this movie would have been better if they got \nsomeone else to play snowwhite! and wtf no one wants to see Charlez Theron \nold and frail come on thats just a no no!'
p11
aS'why he not use his hammer ? i mean... his Thor, am i right ? '
p12
aS'This movie sucked!!! The only good thing about it was Charlez Theron! '
p13
aS'Am I the only one who watched it for Sam Claflin and Chris Hemsworth ? '
p14
aS"totally wouldn't mind Charlize Theron ruling over my kingdom for eternity \njust sayin..."
p15
aS"Cant believe this scrawny bitch acted as Snow White...\nSuch a disappointment...\nThe Hunger Games lady would've suited the role better\nI guess immersion is too much to ask for.... humanity is useless, you can \nall fuck off"
p16
aS'i love this and kristen stewart is with emma watson,jennifer lawrence  the \nbest actress '
p17
aS"I expected much more from it. When i saw the trailer (btw, scene at 1:27 \ndidn't happen), i thought they'd get the most of it, specially from the \nDark Forest. where are the monsters? my grandmother could walk through that \nforest in her wheelchair with one wheel flat. not even mosquitos!"
p18
aS'I actually went to see this. This advertisement and the posters had the \nqueen as the focus. And the queen is amazing. I was willing to put up with \nKristen Stewart to see her. I WAS LIED TO! The queen is barely in the \nmovie! The best parts of the movie were when the queen was on screen -_-'
p19
aS'Mirror Mirror on the wall! Which is the shittiest movie of them all? the \nanswer, right in front of us.'
p20
aS'Haven\'t seen it yet, but a part of me is hoping for Huntsman to \ndump Kristen Stewart and just realize who\'s the fukin "Fairest of them all" \n--> Charlize Theron\nThumbs up so we can conspire enough to make them do the movie again!!! \n(not!) :D\nI have 100% sure Charlize Theron would make a perfect snow white role (just \nwatch her movies and realize how good she can be on terms of goodness and \nsadness emotional issues) about Kristen Stewart since everybody cleary \ndislikes her for her movies made (twilight) and her lack of emotional depth \n(which i agree on this one) i would say her part as a antagonist would fit \nperfectly on her so we could see a diferent role in her career movies for \nonce and probably be dazzled by it.... or not! Its my opinion regarless of \nwhat u might say. Let me know what u think.'
p21
aS'A spin off/sequel is coming in 2016..but this time, theres a reason to be \nhappy!\n\nFRANK DARABONT IS DIRECTING!!! The Director of The Shawshank Redemption, \nThe Green Mile and the first season of The Walking Dead! '
p22
aS"Kristen Stewart and Charlize should've changed their places.\n\nDuno why ppl like Kristen , she is ugly."
p23
aS"I don't understand why people complain, it's still one of the best movies I \nhave ever watched."
p24
aS'I would like to watch this movie for Chris Hemswoth, but Kristen Stewart? \nseriously? You lost me right there.'
p25
aS'Charlize Theron rocks!'
p26
aS"Seriously?? Kristen Steward as Snowwhite? They seem to have forgotten that \nSnowWhite is the fairest of them all. That means you find an actrice who's \nat least able to close her mouth. Or able to smile"
p27
aS'Is this the next twilight movie?'
p28
aS"I thought the movie was okay, it had decent effects and some of the actors \nwhere pretty good. My only complaint was Snow White herself. Not just \nbecause she was played by Kristen Stewart (though she did make Snow pretty \ndull), but the fact that she's built up as the messiah-like character yet \nshe does almost nothing. They tried to make her a badass towards the end, \nbut there is nothing in the film prior to that moment that justifies this."
p29
aS'thx!'
p30
aS"People hated this movie because of Kristen Stewart was in it.\n\nIsn't because Kristen was in twilight (which the movie I really hate) it \ndoesn't mean she is the worst actress.\n\nShe is been in The Panic Room, The messenger, and etc. I love those movies \nand she act pretty well. And her acting in this movie was pretty much \nbetter than twilight. \n\n"
p31
aS'thx!'
p32
aS'Kristen is more beautiful than Charlize Theron?? That mirror high or what?'
p33
aS'Best movie i have ever watched.'
p34
aS'i havent see movie yet i agree that they may pick somebody else maybe that \ngirl that play i other version of snow white she was so beatiful so \ninnosent but that be strange i think they pick kris because of twiligth \nsuces they want fans to pay attension and they pick her annostly in the \nmovie kristen is way move cute than twiligth and abouth that with the story \nmaybe than for some people wh know the fairy tale is bullshit but i find it \nintresting to make somethink new of ours fav fairy tale s yes maybe those \nmovie arent perfevt and have somethink that havent done quet rigth but its \nnot that bad that some of the people say'
p35
aS"I don't remember watching that scene in the movie when the mirror shatters \nand Charlize Theron screams..."
p36
aS'a singer Inna has a song "wow", in her video Inna plays snow white.'
p37
aS'Well, beats Twilight. :)'
p38
aS"00:40 what is that stuff she's soaking in???"
p39
aS'This movie was intense as shit.  What more do you people want?'
p40
aS'Such an amazing trailer...such a disappointment trailer!'
p41
aS'Sam ClaFlin'
p42
aS'1:34 If there is ever a Naruto live action movie, please use this effect \nfor Itachi.'
p43
aS'Movie was meh.. Chris Hemsworth made it worth watching.. its kinda in the \nname.'
p44
aS'Chris Hemsworth >:3  \nYummy <3 ^^'
p45
aS'LEGO Movie = still more facial expression than Kristen Stewart.'
p46
aS'Bring me your haat, my dear, dear Snow White.'
p47
aS'I saw the movie yesterday.. It was awesome, apart from Kristen Stewart.. \nShe had the same facial expression throuought the movie.. Charlize Theron \nplayed the Evil Queen and she really convinced me.. the black bird on this \ntrailer-00:10 has more facial expression than Kristen..  And I just read \nthat Kristen cheated on Robert Patinson with Rupert Sanders-the director of \nSnow White..  This is how untalented people gain roles in movies..'
p48
aS'Kristen is sexy and best actress'
p49
aS'I only wanna see it cuz Bella swan kristen steward is in it!!!! And im a \ntwilight fan hahaha'
p50
aS'Amanda Seyfried shoud was the snow white!'
p51
aS"They should make a movie about the Evil Queen (with Charlize of course) \nlike what they're doing with Maleficent. "
p52
aS'Amazing trailer, terrible movie. Oh well. '
p53
aS"I just don't see kirsten as snow white... :/"
p54
aS'big mistake castin Kristen as snow white and above all on the same screen \nas CHARLIZE! what a fckn INSULT! '
p55
aS'Plus the queen is so much more beautiful '
p56
aS'fab movie'
p57
aS"While I thought the movie was okay, I really didn't care for Kristen \nStewart playing Snow White. Besides the fact that I don't think she played \nthe part well (as apposed to when she was younger and played in The Panic \nRoom and Speak, where she played beautifully), or that she was beautiful \nenough. Yes, she's a very good looking woman, she's just...not Snow White \npretty in my opinion. Her expressions never seem to change...ever. That's \nwhy I hated her playing in Twilight (those movies just sucked in general. \nThey last two weren't complete failures though), she just seemed to make \nthe parts appear awkward. I really did love the movie though. Chris \nHemsworth and Charlize Theron made this movie, mainly Theron. "
p58
aS'in no fucking way is twilight suck my dick girl more beautiful than \ncharlize theron!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! fucking bu llshit american \nteenage generation'
p59
aS'The movie was twisted... but somehow I still think this movie was \nawesome!!!!'
p60
aS'nice scenes , but the twilight girl is annoying , every single scene she is \nin, her mouth is open, only 1 min her mouth is shut when you count all \ntogether from the entire movie, makes me wonder if that is a condition she \nhas, or is her nose shut, and she has to breathe trough her mouth'
p61
aS"Sierously Kristen Stewart fairest? Eww I'm sorry but she is a bad actor and \neven the annoying chipmunk voice Snow White is better."
p62
aS'"Kristen is the best actress" \nI am sorry but she plays always the same. She\'s good but I personally \ndislike her. She looks like she\'s always dying and she\'s always kinda out \nof life. They should have chosen someone else as Snow White... Someone \nbrighter! '
p63
aS'And also I think Lily Collins or Amanda Bynes (who also played snow white) \nwould have been a better pick'
p64
aS'Would have been better if anyone other than Kristen Stewart was playing \nSnow White.'
p65
aS"this is the first movie made on Snow White story where is Evil Queen more \npretty than Snow White,no offence for Kristen but that's what I tkink\nAnd Lily Colins would be much better "
p66
aS'This movie is so underrated. A fantastic and breathtaking performance given \nby Charlize Theron as well as Kristen Stewart. The cinematography and \ngraphic effects were incredible, and I loved the unique storyline. Such a \ngood film.'
p67
aS'Kristen is one of best and beautiful actress u hate her only for her past u \nidiots'
p68
aS'Wow charlize'
p69
aS'I always watch this never get tired of it <3'
p70
aS"I only like watching this film for 1 reason and that is the performance of \nthe beautiful Charlize Theron as the evil queen, I do kind of like Kristen \nStewart, but I'm sorry they could have did a better pick for Snow White in \nthis and the evil queens brother was just stupid"
p71
aS'0:56 ruined the triler. The only good part is Theron PERIOD.'
p72
aS"Charlize Theron: Mirror Mirror on the wall... who's the fairest of them \nall?...\nMirror: You are the fairest in all the land your majesty. But there is one \ndestined to rise up and challenge you.\nCharlize: And who should that potential nemesis be?\nMirror: Kristen Stewart is her name. (shows image of the nemesis complete \nwith open mouth, wooden expression, and junkie appearance)\nCharlize: HOW DARE YOU MOCK ME WITH THAT WOODEN STUTTERING OPEN-MOUTHED \nWHORE!!!!!! (Draws out her sword and uses it to shatter the mirror)"
p73
aS'What have they been doing to these princesses!'
p74
aS"Okay seriously...Charlize Theron is the most beautiful person in this \nmovie...NOT Kristen Stewart.  Come on yall it's totes true. "
p75
aS"Kristen may not be as 'fair' as Charlize but she looks good enough to play \nSnow White... I can't say the same about her acting though."
p76
aS'watched this movie love it'
p77
aS'The movie is great, Kristen is one of the best actresses I have even seen, \nbut I think the whole cast is fantastic. I love the movie & I love Kristen \n<3'
p78
aS'I still do not understand how Kristen Stewart could be described as having: \nhair as black as night, skin as white as snow and lips as red as blood! '
p79
aS"i didn't see this in theaters but i've seen it on tv and it wasn't that \nbad, the things i disliked most about the film were the queen's creepy \nbrother and the fairies in the forest"
p80
aS'Charlize Theron is just fucking amazing in this movie <3 one of the best \nmovies that i watched'
p81
aS'Joan of Arc and the Asgardian'
p82
aS"I think Kristen did a great job, she finally played a role were her \ncharacter wasn't weak. We get to see a different side of her"
p83
aS"What can I say about this movie...\nThe camera work was epic... The fairy forest with the white deer was \nperfect and epic. The magic of the evil queen was epic. \nCharlize Theron did a perfect job I loved her evil queen and\nChris Hemsworth did also a great job! Music was great to and I loved the \nfact that the movie gave you an LotR feeling.\nBut the story itself was overhasty and missed some dept. Some unimportant \nscene's was giving to much time and it would be nice if they had given some \nother parts of the movie more dept.  \n\nI don't want to talk about Kristen Stewart. \nI don't know is she is a good actress or not because I haven't see an other \nmovie (except twilight 1, which I hated and because of this-  didn't watch \nthe other parts) with her. But she failed as Snow White. I just couldn't \nbuy it. Maybe it was because of her character or because of the actress. "
p84
aS"When I first saw Kristen as Snow White, I was like: DDDD: Ugh, don't watch."
p85
aS'I just watched this movie and surprisingly it was not good. Skip this one.'
p86
aS'The soundtrack was amazing movie not so much'
p87
aS'This is a great trailer but the movie sucked so much'
p88
aS'Chills =)'
p89
aS"Oh hell no. Kristen Stewart couldn't win a beauty competition, even if she \nwas the only one running."
p90
aS'Emma watson should be the one who played the role as snow white...'
p91
aS'This movie was so boring imo'
p92
aS"Probably one of the best trailers I have ever seen! :) The movie wasn't the \nbest but it was still very good! :) "
p93
aS'Charlize Theron was far more beautiful than Kristen Stewart! I thought snow \nwhite was supposed to be a threat to the queen? Someone fire the casting \ndirector!'
p94
aS"Charlize Theron was just prefect as the Queen.  She was evil, insane, \nscared (of losing her beauty).  In the scene where she confronts her \nbrother after Snow White got away was great.  The look on Charlize's face \nwas scary good.  You could feel the scene.   She can act.  Sadly Stewart is \nso wooden anything she's in is painful to watch.  Without Theron carrying \nthe film this would have lost money.  Had it been more about the Queen with \nSnow White as the sub plot it would have been better film.  The Queen's \ncharacter was so much more interesting.  And Theron can actually act which \nwould have helped."
p95
aS"I don't see how the ratings and be so low on this movie. I thought it was \nAMAZING. at first I didn't think kristen could pull off her role, but she \nwas great! I don't know what to think of a sequel. I hope it's as amazing"
p96
aS'C. Theron extra-hot as **** in this one'
p97
