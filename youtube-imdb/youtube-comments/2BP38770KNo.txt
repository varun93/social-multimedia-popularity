aS'I ask my fellow HTTYD fans to reconsider going on any of these sites where \nyou can watch the movie "early". Think of how epic it will be viewing this \nstory for the "FIRST TIME" on the big screen! The way it was meant to be. \nDreamworks has put a great deal of effort into this for the fans. We\'ve \nbeen begging for a sequel and they have granted us our wish. Do you really \nwant to repay them by watching it on a website that has smuggled it? Please \nthink about your choice carefully.'
