aS'*IN REAL LIFE...* this would\'ve been over within 5 minutes *after* the \nNorth Korean Villain appeared to Secretary of State....if I was Secretary \nof State. I\'d have said: *"Either hand over all your weapons to the \nPresident & his staff & come out right now or we will kill all of you even \nif it means the President\'s death. You have 60 seconds to comply."* Then \ncut all communication & just follow through!'

p19
aS'its a very great movie....'
p20
aS'I hate brainwashing films like this. Knowing how corrupt our government is \nand they want everybody to feel sorry for them when most all of the world\'s \nproblems disseminate from that place. Corruption, Murderer\'s, Liars and \nthieves adorn the walls of the whitehouse. Just like what +ensitu said \nbelow and I quote him/her. "would never happen, all of America\'s enemies \nare already inside the WH"'
p21
aS'This movie was fantastic. Even my mom, who hates war movies, loved this. \nWhat did I like about it? It does not glorify war, rather it shows the \nhorrors of it and discourages it, while still saluting our soldiers who put \ntheir lives on the line.\n\nWar must be, while we defend our lives against a destroyer who would \ndevour all; but I do not love the bright sword for its sharpness, nor the \narrow for its swiftness, nor the warrior for his glory. I love only that \nwhich they defend. \n J.R.R. Tolkien, The Two Towers'
p22
aS'True. Again some manipulating movie. I think the movie makers are grown up \nin manipulated world. I advise for start trailer of "In Qontrol 2009 | \nOfficial Q-dance Trailer" Movie makers obviously dont know meaning the word \n"Terrorist". Gen Wesley Clark Reveals US Plan To Invade Iraq, Syria, \nLebanon ect. Search on youtube. Find you truth. Open your eyes everyone.'
p23
aS'i like and hate this moviebecause -The Leading actor Falls and still can \nmove freely without any dis functions in his body -he killed all the \nterrorist all by himself -he knows where the enemies are inthewhitehouse \n-and in the last part the president was still alive even though he lost a \nlot of blood and if you look closer when the terrorist leader was killed \nhis lips was white and when the president went outside his lips was pink \nagain. even though this is just a fantasy movie I enjoyed it'

p26
aS'I\'m temporarily back from my tennis and cricket endeavours, folks, to share \nwith you some thoughts...\n\nLast night, I watched Olympus Has Fallen and I thought;\n\n"Only the Americans could make a film about terrorists blowing up the White \nHouse and feeding all the fruitcakes in the world with some more screw ball \nideas."\n\nI then went on to Ebay and ordered some false eyebrows, a headscarf and \nsome dark sunglasses. +Phil Simpkin I ordered you a toga, turban and a \nlarge banana to tape under your armpit. You can distract the armed forces \nout the front whilst I slip in the back door and pelt the president with \ntomatoes.'

aS"1. US govt destroying WTC: not proven. 2. Beginning Iraq war: A unjust war? \nYes. An act of terrorism? Of course not. The purpose was not to scare the \nworld, it was just a dumb move made by an even dumber president. 3. By \n'dillers' I assume you mean dealers: Again this is not proven, and any \nweapons that do end up in criminal organizations are done unknowingly (the \nseller is unaware of the true identity of the buyer)."
