S'Me gust... '
p1
aS"this movie is just excellent, I don't know why the ratings were so bad"
p2
aS'a few more tropes, one liners and worn out devices, please'
p3
aS'too dam good'
p4
aS'Nice !!\n'
p5
aS'i <3 jamie bell. i will, however admit that some of his movie choices are \nabsolute shit but ever so oftern he scores a good role and regains his \nreputation.'
p6
aS'The movie is crap.'
p7
aS"2:10, yes I noticed it and I'm a man. >:l"
p8
aS'very good movie'
p9
aS'My friend don\'t you see you\'re still contradicting yourself? Not to mention \nthat you haven\'t answered all my questions!! I beg you pardon but what I\'m \ndoing here is having conversation with you from your point of belief, which \nsays Jesus is a perfect human life yet you say being perfect doesn\'t mean \nyou won\'t die from natural causes nor means you won\'t need to feed, then \nagain you say some of our cells can\'t be regenerated "I assume that \nincludes Jesus since that\'s a natural thing"'
p10
aS'I saw it several times, great movie !'
p11
aS'yup im so bored and i saw that jaybob uploaded this movie and then i \nthought to myself why wont i check the trailer xD'
p12
aS"Let me try to answer this step by step... 1. Being perfect doesn't mean you \ncan't die. It just means that you won't die from natural causes (sickness). \nNeither does it mean that you don't have to eat. Adam and Eve were perfect, \nthey still had to eat to feed their body. Now in Jesus case, he was killed. \nBeing perfect doesn't mean you become some kind of superhuman. You know \nscientists don't quite know why our cells stop regenerating at some point; \nwell it's not mystery.It's imperfection my friend"
p13
aS'very* '
p14
aS'veery nice movie :)'
p15
aS'that moment when no one gives a fuck about what people are saying about \nreligion and shit and just watches the trailer'
p16
aS"I'd prefer if you write what your bible says, coz I don't have it to read \nwhat you've marked for me, if Jesus is a perfect human life how did he die \nin the 1st place? I mean if he's so perfect how could he age or die? why \nwould he even need to feed to survive? and can you please tell me what \nJesus is made of if God didn't use anything else to create him? and how \ncould God even need Jesus to help in creation if God created Jesus by \nhimself in the 1st place? Don't you see few contradictions here?"
p17
aS'ive had this on repeat for about 3 hours now itz the shit'
p18
aS'well my friend, the bible clearly says that he was resurrected by GOD and \nwent to heavens to sit next to his father where all power was given to him \nby God. (1 Corinthians 15:28,29)'
p19
aS'soooo many blind ppl nowa days '
p20
aS"Well there are a lot of reasons why this needed to be done, but the main \nreason is he had to come replace what was lost by Adam: perfect human life. \nDon't take my word for it.Please Read Romans 5:12-16. you will have a \nbetter understanding of what I'm trying to say. And Jesus is the Son of God \nbecause God created him first (Col 1:15) and God didn't use anything else \nto create him. (Jesus was there to assist creating all other creatures, \nanimate and inanimate). (John 1:2,3... Col 1:16,17)"
p21
aS'... wtf, like a ironman timex..'
p22
aS'HD?! Video quality is pure garbage.'
p23
aS'The one and only one who can save you is God, not Jesus... Not Moses not \neven Prophet Mohammed Peace be upon them all, they were mere humans with a \nmessage from God, their mission was to invite us to worship the one and \nonly one who is worthy to be worshiped.... God almighty, you worship him \nand follow his instructions, and you get to go to Paradise'
p24
aS'1- Just to let you know, I DON\'T believe God has any son not even Jesus nor \nare we, God the almighty has never nor shall he have any son at all times \nGlory be to him, your bible says in Gosbel of Barnabas: "And having said \nthis, Jesus smote his face with both his hands, and then smote the ground \nwith his head. And having raised his head, he said: "Cursed be every one \nwho shall insert into my sayings that I am the son of God."53:6... to be \ncontinued...'

p35
aS'Yes the movie is awesome but the ending is kinda meh. A wild hobo appears \nand tackles the bad guy ;/'
p36
aS'looks like fun. tomatoes hates it. which has actually become a good sign. \nlead looks like a standard issue gq model, and is a nobody. NOT good signs, \nespecially in combination. suggest a little more shopping.'
p37
aS'Stop telling people about torrent sites.. People like you made ACTA a \nreality'
p38
aS'2- now Based on all of that, this means imperfection, now how can some \nimperfection being can assist God in the creation?! and doesn\'t that mean \nGod is imperfect? I\'m still demanding the meaning of "Jesus is God\'s son", \nif Angels are God\'s sons as well then that means they are Jesus\'s brothers, \nyet they don\'t feed nor age or die?! how is that possible?!'
p39
aS'are you having this debate because you thought this movie was "the ledge" \n(pro atheism movie) or was also this one pro atheism (i have not seen it)?'
p40
aS'Well not like God had intercourse with another being to have Jesus.... I \nhate to sound repetitive here, but he is called the Only-Begotten Son Of \nGod because God created him first, and he is unique in the sense that when \nhe was created, God did so alone. You are right in a way that we are all \nSons of God like the Angels but Jesus is unique. '
p41
aS'oke,, i will remove it.. '
p42
aS'Thanks for the trailer! I used it for a review I did for "Man on a Ledge." '
p43
aS'This movie increases my dislike for cops but not all cops dirty cops its \nashamed that ppl you have no values can be bought and used.'
p44
aS'I don\'t get it. "The ledge", now "Man on a ledge"...Hollywood made two \ncopycat movies within a year?'
p45
aS'I beg you pardon but what you said was "how Jesus was created from the \nbeginning, and Jesus is the son of God as well as the angels", but that \ndoesn\'t explain how\'s Jesus is the son of God literally, you see based on \nyour theory that makes everybody sons of God including me and you, because \nbasically we were created by God just like Jesus and the angels!! If you \nare interested I can give you a theory of my own and then we can compare \nyour theory with mine and see which one makes more sense!!'
p46
aS'"Czowiek na krawdzi" Zajebisty Film!'

p58
aS'It was good - keeps you wondering and plenty of action. Definitely will be \nwatching again.'
p59
aS'Dude you need to do better than this if you wanna keep this chat up... \nthat\'s of course if you are interested in it in the 1st place, and you \nstill didn\'t explain how\'s Jesus is the son of God literally? I mean we all \nknow that God has created him, but being created by God doesn\'t make him \nthe son of God, just like assuming you created a door... does that make the \ndoor your son?! if we are all sons of God "in a way" then at least we share \nthe same characteristics of Jesus since he\'s our brother!'

aS'this is not a trailer this a spoiler!'
p68
aS'just watched this movie... so nice... :)'
p69
aS'Love this movie!!'
p70
aS'uh No... It doesn\'t mean that Jesus is God. The bible states that God gave \nJesus the gift of immortality.. doesn\'t mean God doesn\'t have it anymore. \nMatter of fact, 144,000 will also receive it. (But that\'s a whole other \ntopic). And he can\'t get shot in the head, or tortured by anyone/anything \nanymore because he is not human anymore. Humans live on earth, Spirits live \nwith God in the Heavens. That\'s why he had to come on Earth to give his \n"human life". '
p71
aS"Jesus is the Son of God, but the angels are also Sons of God. (Job 38:4-7). \nThe spiritual creatures are not made of matter, their composition is \nunknown to us for now. (but that's not important). The bible says that \nthere is only one Creator, God.. but Jesus was there assisting him in all \nthe creations."

aS"i believe in what I'm talking about... and I did give you a straightforward \nanswer. I just want you to explain to me what 1 Corinthians 15:28,29 is \nsaying and then we'll be done. (If you can show me in that verse that Jesus \nis God, I will agree with you sir) Hope you're having a wonderful day btw.-"
p85
aS"Why does this movie have such a retarded title? Because it's an awesome \nfilm."
p86
aS'THIS MOVIE IS DAMN GOOD !!! i watched it and was at the edge of my seat. \none of the best movies of recent times. '
p87
aS'that blonde women is such an annoying actress'
p88
aS"I liked this movie, it was a lot better than I thought it was going to be. \nI thought it was going to be like Phone Booth, but instead of spending the \nwhole movie on the phone, he spends the whole movie on the ledge- which yes \nthat's part of it, but you see a lot of other things too."
p89
aS'i just watched it , so good'
p90
aS'I dont think he wants to do another M an on Another Fucking ledge! :D'
p91
aS'What the fuck??LMao you gta be kidding me'
p92
aS'lovely movie. very god. goto: watchmoviesforfreeonline net'
p93
aS"It is not a theory. It is related in the bible, And you are right in a way \nwe are all in someway Sons of God. Because Adam was called a son of God. \nMatthew 1. But humans haven't been called the Sons of God ever since Adam \nrebelled against God and humankind became distant to God. However, with the \nsacrifice of Jesus we have the opportunity to become close to God again in \nthe near future"
p94
aS"Somebody said no one can save you from the ledge my friend.. lol... and Idk \nhow we got here, but I don't mind."
p95
aS'How did a MOVIE TRAILER end up talking about God?'
p96
aS'But the bible only calls Jesus "the only-begotten Son" because he really is \nunique. There was not another creature present when Jesus was being \ncreated. (Col 1:15). But Yes, I would love to hear your theory sir. (Sorry, \nit took so long for me to write back)'
