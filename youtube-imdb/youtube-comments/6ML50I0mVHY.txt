p14
aS':( looks like such a good movie'
p15
aS"This movie is not very difficult to understand. I couldn't find any hidden \nmeanings, and yes you need to use more brain power than your mainstream \nHollywood film. What I suggest is for you to be attentive to the dialogue \nand you will surely understand it,  because to me it seems pretty direct."

p37
aS'song??'
p38
aS"I really have to say that this movie was dark, intelligent, and complex... \nI had to see it a few times to really grasp the depth of this movie because \nit's smart and the actors don't really give you a chance to catch up with \nthem... Great cast, and the reality of the drug world that brings even the \nmost succesful people down... I would have to say the best movie of the \nyear!! But a lot of ppl that don't know the reality of the drug world \nwouldn't understand this movie"
p39
aS'I like Ridley scott visual style and Counsellor has a lot of good shots.. \nand good cheetahs but This movie was all about corruption and evil texas \nand mexico..I am stll trying to understand the message...I usally prefer \ngood vs evil direct movies'

p42
aS'CAF MAN They hear somebody in the street they shoot them. Then they turn\non the light to see who is dead.\n\nCOUNSELOR Why do they do that?\n\nCAF MAN (Shrugging) To make a joke. To show that death does not care.\nThat death has no meaning.\n\nCOUNSELOR Qu piensa? Usted. Do you believe that?\n\nCAF MAN No. Of course not. All my family is dead. I am the one who has no\nmeaning.\n\nClassic McCarthy'
p43
aS"I actually really dug this movie. I really loved it. It was like a \nShakespearian tragedy. Michael Fassbender was excellent in the role. He is \nquickly becoming one of my favorite actors. I really don't understand why \nso many people hated this. I hope that in a couple of years, this will \nbecome an appreciated masterpiece. The same thing happened with Taxi \nDriver. It gained mixed reviews back when it was released. now, it's hailed \nas a masterpiece. Hopefully, films like this get the same treatment."

aS'Looks nice'
p49
aS'a very bad movie a wasted my time watching this shit shame on u Brad'
p50
aS'This was shit.'
p51
aS"The cinematography was good.  I feel like the whole movie should have just \nbeen a novel or novella.  The majority of the dialogue reeked of McCarthy's \nstyle (duh.) which I feel works SO much better as prose rather than as \nspoken word (example: the scene in the beginning between Bardem and Diaz \nabout the drink representing nothing other than itself).  Also I feel like \nthe characters would have really worked in a book but were cheapened in the \nfilm with the exception of Pitt and Fassbender. Overall a good movie but I \nwish it had been a book instead."
p52
aS'Cormac probably wrote this in his sleep'
p53
aS'Watched this...over two hours of painfully longwinded scenes and the ending \nleft me feeling like I wasted too much of my life...great acting though and \nthe FXMU in the murder scenes was wicked!'

p61
aS"I know good movies.. this is not one of them. Didn't wanna listen to the \nbad reviews but people out there know what they are talking about. This \nmovie is bad. The story line is just stupid and slow. Good acting though \nbut bad story line. Can't feel the emotion being portrayed (I normally shed \na tear to good emotion) but this one was dry. "
p62
aS'It looks like shit'
p63
aS'What the f**ck...\nNot a good movie.. nice cast but no story..\nWhen the movie stopt. i said to myself..\nWtf Is that a stuppid movie..\nWaste of time'
p64
aS'Trailer looks amazing but the film is absolute shit, Talk about slow  ZZZZ \nThats 2 hours of my life i will never get back. '
p65
aS"I loved this movie, but to say to others they need to be 'intelligent' to \nunderstand it, is both misguided and unintelligent. The main demographic \nthis film will appeal to is for the people that enjoy Cormac \nMcCarthy's style and structure of story-telling. However, the majority \nwill natural expect the classical story-telling device which the film does \nnot follow. Which is fine, but it wont be for everyone's taste."
p66
aS"THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN. YOU DON'T NEED TO BE A SMART \nASS TO APPRECIATE IT. TOTAL WASTE OF TIME. "

p77
aS'I am intelligent and understanded the movie but...\nDidnt like anyway !!'
p78
aS'I have just read the screenplay, not seen the movie yet - and maybe I will \nnot.\nFor me the story is about human will, love, pride, ambition, fault, sin and \ninnocence.\nYou can actually find a lot of connection with religious and philosophical \nstruggles: not bad for a quite short story, indeed.'
p79
aS'Trailer 95% good, Movie 95% bad'
p80
aS':/ i thought this was going to be a sequel to bad teacher. '
p81
aS'song name?'
p82
aS"A terrific movie that was sabotaged by disingenuous movie reviews because \nthe Cohen Brothers weren't involved in it.  That's the only reason why an \nunapologetically dark movie like No Country For Old Men got rave reviews \nwhile this film, completely unique yet cut from the same cloth, was trashed \nby hack reviewers.\n\nIt's a shame Roger Ebert had passed before he could review this phenomenal \nfilm, he may have set some of the payola critics straight."
p83

aS"I can't believe this person below said that its a brilliant movie and \nrequires intelligence to understand it. I don't know what shit you are \nsmoking but this is one of the most boring movies EVER. Not worth $1.29 I \npaid at the redbox. "

aS'stop asking what the fucking song is.... just look a few comments down and \nit will fucking be there 1000 times or use shazam or type a few lyrics into \ngoogle.... ffs people are fucking idiots'
p91
aS"The trailer leads people into thinking that the movie is thrilling and \naction-packed, but the dialogue is heavy with philosophy. I don't know if \nI'm not intelligent enough to understand, but from what I thought, it \nseemed that the characters used big words and poetic sentences to conceal \nthe fact that, really, they weren't saying anything substantial at all. \nThis movie is in a genre on its own, but I don't really take that as a good \nthing."
p92
aS'The story begins with a man, known only as "The Counselor" (Michael \nFassbender) and his girlfriend Laura (Penlope Cruz), lying in bed and \nhaving oral sex. Somewhere in Mexico, cocaine is being packaged in barrels \nand concealed in a sewage truck. The truck is driven across the border and \nstored at a sewage treatment plant. The Counselor goes to Amsterdam on what \nhe claims is a business trip, but is actually a meeting with a diamond \ndealer (Bruno Ganz) in order to purchase an engagement ring for Laura. Back \nin the United States, The Counselor proposes to Laura, and she accepts. \nLater, he attends a party at a house owned by Reiner (Javier Bardem) and \nhis girlfriend Malkina (Cameron Diaz). The Counselor and Reiner have a \nlengthy discussion, during which Reiner claims that The Counselor is not \ncapitalizing on his position of power as much as he could be. The Counselor \nmeets with Westray (Brad Pitt), a business associate, to express interest \nin a drug deal with a four-thousand percent return rate.\nWestray warns The Counselor about becoming involved in such a deal, saying \nthat Mexican cartels are merciless, particularly to lawyers. Later, The \nCounselor visits one of his clients, a prison inmate named Ruth (Rosie \nPerez) who is on trial for murder. Ruth\'s son is a biker and a high-level \ncartel member known as "The Green Hornet" recently arrested for speeding. \nThe Counselor agrees to bail him out of jail. Malkina employs "The Wireman" \n(Sam Spruell) to steal the drugs. He does this by decapitating the biker \nwith a wire stretched across the highway. After collecting the component \nthat will allow the sewage truck to start, The Wireman drives to the sewage \ntreatment plant, where he steals the truck containing the cocaine. Learning \nof this incident, Westray calls The Counselor to notify him that The Green \nHornet is dead and that the cocaine has been stolen, bleakly intoning The \nCounselor\'s culpability.\nSimultaneously, both Ruth and the cartel link The Counselor to the death of \nthe biker and the theft of the drugs. The cartel has found that he bailed \nout The Green Hornet, which appears as suspect timing and fully blameworthy \nfor the putative purposes of the cartel. The Counselor seeks help from \nReiner but receives nothing more than Reiner telling him that his fate is \nsealed. In Texas, two cartel members pretending to be police officers pull \nover The Wireman and his accomplice. A shootout ensues when the accomplice \nshoots and kills one of the "officers" and wounds the other. The wounded \ncartel member manages to kill the accomplice and The Wireman, accidentally \nshooting the sewage truck and gunning down a passing-by driver. Reiner is \naccidentally killed by cartel members while attempting to capture him, and \nLaura is simultaneously kidnapped. In a last-ditch effort, The Counselor \ncontacts Jefe (Rubn Blades), a high-ranking cartel member, for information \non the whereabouts of Laura, Reiner and Westray. Jefe advises The Counselor \nto live with the choices he has made, even refusing his offer to switch \nplaces with Laura.\nAfter the truck is fixed and the wounded cartel member is cared for, he \ngoes to the meeting location where the buyer (Dean Norris) gets his \ncocaine. The Counselor goes back to Mexico, hoping to find Laura. A package \nis slipped under the door of his hotel room. He opens it and finds a DVD \nwith "Hola!" written on the side. The Counselor breaks down completely, \nheavily implying that the disk contains an execution video of Laura from \nthe cartel. Laura\'s decapitated body is dumped at a landfill. Meanwhile, \nMalkina\'s failed effort to steal the drugs means that she is out the money \nshe wants. She tracks Westray in London, hires a woman (Natalie Dormer) to \nseduce him and steal his bank codes. She then has Westray brutally killed \nto get his computer to access the account. Malkina then meets her banker \n(Goran Vinji) at an expensive restaurant. They talk about how she should \nuse her money. She advises him that he is in over his head and that he \nneeds to get out of the business because if need be, he would be \nexpendable. They turn to what to order and the film ends with her saying \n"I\'m famished"\nSource:Wikipedia \n'
