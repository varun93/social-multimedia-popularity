aS'Bruce sprinsteing - the wrestler is the song.'
p26
aS'There is something I need explained to me BADLY: How are "The Wrestler" and \n"Black Swan" considered companion pieces?\n\n"The Wrestler" was a drama that told a very powerful story about a washed \nup man who, while trying to find love and reconnect with his daughter, is \ntrying to regain his fame while he knows he doesn\'t have much time left. A \nmovie that makes men cry because it\'s so believable.\n"Black Swan" is a horror film that tells the story of a ballerina who, \nunder the pressure of her controlling mother, the stress of her passionate \nteacher, and the rivalry between her and a darker, seductive dancer, \ncompletely loses her mind and sight of reality as she lets all three \nsmother her and causes her to truly unleash her dark side. A horror story \nset against an elegant world that will show you the greatest terrors are in \nyour own mind.\n\nThese films are completely different in nature and genre, which makes me \nwonder how the hell they\'re companions. I understand their leads are \ninvolved deeply in different forms of art, but that\'s where it stops. Are \nthey considered companions because they used to be one entire film? I NEED \nTO KNOW!!! If anyone truly knows, and I mean ANYBODY, please answer it for \nme.'

And now, I'm an old broken down piece of meat... and I'm \nalone. And I deserve to be all alone. I just don't want you to hate me."
p56
aS"I really like this movie.  Watching Mickey Rourke however just drains the \nlife out of me every time I watch it though, like he's painful to watch.  \nNot that it's bad acting, not at all, but it's like this sad, empty, lonely \nfeeling."
p57

aS"Rourke should have gotten the award for best actor. The only reason Sean \nPenn got it is because the Academy is a bunch of liberal prisses who were \ncampaigning gay marriage rights. And while that's all and well, don't \nignore the true fact that Rourke did a better job acting. It's why the \nAcademy is pissing me off. They only recognize films that have political, \nsocial, or economic portrayals. This was a superb film that should have \ngotten ay more than it was given"
p96
aS'Best movie of all fucking time.'
