p41
aS"@TheVictorb2696 Kate Winslet's character was not a crazy person per se. She \nwas a Nazi SS guard at Auschwitz, and for reasons unknown, was also \nilliterate, and the film breaks down the moral conflict of her effect on \nher lover, who, like us, cannot easily comprehend how someone like her can \nfunction and survive. "
p42
aS'@abers109 of course she is!'
p43
aS'@Cabess12 well the english one is just her talking.'

p59
aS"this movie was STUNNING. a lot of times trailers don't do films justice, \nbut watching this trailer just now gave me chills remembering watching the \nmovie. "
p60
aS'@PureWay4 So you say that a book that is all firm and settled and was made \nand written in the past 4000 years is less accurate than a brutal terrorist \nreligion that was made like 1000 years? come on, get a life. Islam is a \nterrorist religion that seeks to kill and take over. I know your Quran, it \nsays to kill everyone who doesnt beleive in your Muhamad..'
p61
aS'Ralph Fiennes is amazing in this movie!'
p62
aS'lol, I almost thought it was Liam Neeson for a second!'

p66
aS'@joellynmorgan no she was an Nazi. this story took palce 13 years after the \nholocaust. '
p67
aS'@NatRougeProductions oooh okay thanks! im gonna havre to watch it.'
p68
aS'I know the second song is "Primavera", but what about the song that starts \nat :10 and goes until :48. Does anyone know what the first song of the \ntrailer is??'
p69
aS'sorry to be the bitch but... of course she can do an english accent! shes \nfricken english!'

p78
aS'Definitivamente, yo la vi casi por error y me hizo replantear demasiadas \ncosas: con quin quieres estar? qu estaras dispuesto a perdonar por esa \npersona amada? El mensaje de la pelcula me lleg y lo aplique a mi \nrealidad, en su momento me ayud mucho'
p79
aS"maybe, but I didn't hate her at all. I felt a tremendous amount of sympathy \nfor her, which is bizzare, when you've come to thought what she did."
p80
aS'@joellynmorgan no she was an Nazi. this story took palce 13 years after the \nholocaust. '

p88
aS"0:09 What's that song?"
p89
aS'Simply, amazing..'
p90
aS'the name of the song?'
p91
aS'Sticks and stones my friend. Your insults are nothing new.'
p92
aS'@naizo10 really? but has anyone noticed that Hanna Schmidt is technically a \npedophile, according to our age of consent standards? She is 36 years old \nand she has sex with a boy that can be her son. The boy is 15 years old. \nYet nobody is so upset by this. But Lolita, whose action takes place in the \nsame period as part 1 of The Reader, has always been frown upon by many for \nits theme, an adult-teen affair and the book was forbidden in U.S.A for \nmany years. Pretty weird attitude. '
p93
aS"@pinkpinkpink30 the book is amazing and i am kind of glad they have chosen \nKate for the main act, but i'm pretty sure most of people had no idea of \nthe book and it just kills the very essence of this film"
p94
aS'@Tkdlolboy91 Its Primavera :) Such a good song '
p95
aS'oh god the book was fucking awesome! i did not imagine young michael to \nlook like this though lol'
p96
aS'This movie so much reminds me of an ass-hole(Ralph Finnes) and me. \nDifference is I never forgave him after realizing my tragedy was a joke to \nhim, and he thinks I m a joke. So in a way I feel like Jewish woman- one \ncan t change past.'
