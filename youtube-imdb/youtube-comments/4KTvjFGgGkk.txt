S'Thor and that girl have such great chemistry- it really makes a movie work. \n5 stars!'
p1
aS"it's good"
p2
aS"Enjoyed it as a simple movie but not a patch on the first one (come back \nKenneth). Too much like a computer game, too much shoot 'em up without \nthinking about whats actually going on or character development or even the \nweaponry. Asgaardian soldiers with no back up to their swords and armour \nwhen faced by inter-galactic foes?  Not very likely given Asgaards \nfamiliarity with space travel. Asgaards defences were pathetic. Thors \nhammer could knock over the head baddy but could be deflected by the \nbaddies number two! The colossal figure Thor destroyed in the first movie \nwould surely have been rebuilt by Odin and why not have more than one? \nClearly a more powerful defence than we saw in this movie. Thor and Loki \nhave great character potential seriously wasted in this film as were the \nother leading figures."
p3
aS'Its funny how the perspective of each of the avengers faces an issue. Iron \nman had to deal with a fake villain. Capt amer is fighting a corrupt \ngovernment agency and thor has to save a universe. '
p4
aS'Chris Hemsworth is just so so so  freaking cute :D thats the only reason i \nwatch this movie! '
p5
aS"Have just watched Thor: The Dark World for the first time. Compared to some \nof the films I've seen lately it was fairly decent.\n\nAlso came with a Welsh treat for Saint David's Day. Both Snowdon(tallest \nmountain in Wales and approx 11 miles as the crow flies from me) got a \nmention as well as Great Orme which those who know Llandudno on the north \nWales coast will know is a hill/headland in Llandudno. When I was a kid my \nparents, sister and I used to stay in a holiday flat on Little Orme which \nis on the other end of the north beach.\n\nAlso had a lol at Thor catching an underground train and have to admit I \ndidn't expect the twist at the end ( I won't mention what happened and I \nask that those who comment on this post don't as there might be readers who \nhaven't seen the film yet)"
p6
aS'I watched the movie Thor 2.. seem ok. movie bad'
p7
aS'As usual Loki steal the scene again and the movie is boring getting me \nsleepy until I saw the end credit scene.'
p8
aS'Thor...Thor 2...The Avengers...All this could be avoided if Heimdall could \nactually see shit that mattered. '
p9
aS'Stupid movie! '
p10
aS'Out of the whole movie, the absolute best part is when Loki like turns into \nCaptain America and starts dancing around.'
p11
aS'Harcules'
p12
aS'Loki saved the movie'
p13
aS'HOW DARE SHE SLAP MY KING!YOU ARE NO MATCH FOR LOKI YOU WORTHLESS MORTAL!!! \n+.+'
p14
aS'Im a marvel universe freak i want to see this movie so bad! Chris pkays \nthor like no other but he is the best with the avengers by far but each \nsuper hero seprate is bomb but when they come together,mutha fuckin \nheroshima!'
p15
aS"Not sure about all the naysayers on here, but my roommates and I loved it! \nWe did yell at the TV quite a bit. Surprisingly, it was better than the \nfirst one. I didn't think that was possible. I can't wait to see the next \none. "
p16
aS'Went to the cinema to see it and really liked it all the way through and a \nmassive improvement from the first installment.'
p17
aS'shit ass movie,  riddick is better than this'
p18
aS"This was a good film... The ending of Loki on the throne was a surprise for \nme... And it obviously is an opening for a Thor 3 film... I really like how \nthey have made all of the films linked together, and I can't wait for the \nnext 2 Avengers films...\n\nAll the crybabies who are complaining about the film should simply shut up \nand enjoy them... If you think you can make a better film, then shut up and \nprove it! But, no! All you'll do is cry and complain, and sit at home, \nplaying with yourself and do nothing!"
p19
aS'This movie will earn more if they change the tittle to \n\nLOKI and his brother : The Dark World '
p20
aS"THOR 2 on my page and kindly please like my page https://w w w .facebook. \ncom/fullhdmovie... i'm uploading LATEST and PAST movies everyday.. you can \nalso request movies you want then i'll just upload it :)"
p21
aS'*punch* that was for New York! \nI like her'
p22
aS"it was an amazing movie!! don't miss the scenes during  credits"
p23
aS'Loki is the reason i watched - The avengers Thor and Thor the dark world '
p24
aS'This falls under the category of: OVER MARKETED! it was no where near what \nthe first thor was. Boring, no storyline to speak of and way to much \nattention to CGI effects. Turned it off after about 30 minuets.'
p25
aS'I watched Thor: The Dark World, more commonly known as Thor 2. It was much \nbetter than the first film. I had a fun time. Be sure to sit through to the \nvery end of the credits.\n\n#thorthedarkworld   #thor2   #marvel  '
p26
aS"You know what I'd like to see in the next film? A cameo of Zeus and the \nOlympians. Yes. They exist in the Marvelverse. I want to see how they're \nrepresented on screen."
p27
aS'Liked this movie.......Note:Thor was a Turk ? Sweden\'s first prof.Sven \nLagerbring(1707-1787) ; " Our ancestors are Turks who are comrades of \nOden.Oden and his comrades were Turks.We have got enough evidence on this \nsubject ".'
p28
aS'Anyone else? who wanna get a hit?'
p29
aS"Hi I've written a fanfiction about Loki on Wattpad.com about the love story \nbetween Loki and Darcy Lewis's little sister, a girl he captured along with \nfive others because six infinity stones have buried themselves inside them. \nIt is an alteration to this movie. It's called Time and Mischief. Sorry \nthis is probably annoying, but please go check it out and tell me what you \nthink! The Avengers will also make an appearance! Thanks for reading."
p30
aS'this is really g'
p31
aS'who watched world war hulk the cartoon?does the big ugly rock thing remind \nu of anything?'
p32
aS'good'
p33
aS"The person talking at 1:31-1:44 sounds so familiar but i can't place them \nfor some reason"
p34
aS"(Sigh) it seems like everybody hates everything present-day. I liked \nSpiderman 3, Iron Man 3, & Thor: The Dark World, & I loved Avengers. Call \nme girly if you want but I also liked Frozen, more of a musical then I \nthought it was gonna be & that's a negative thing about it, & I don't love \nFrozen I've seen plenty of movies far better then that."
p35
aS"fortunately peter jackson showed more respect to tolkien's world than these \npeople showed to valhala and the sagas. "
p36
aS'Was at cinema today. Movie was amazing, as all Marvel movies. '
p37
aS'omg'
p38
aS'When he says "I like her" <3 <3'

aS'Thor 3 fvrt super hero ever'
p52
aS'good movie. the morale of the movie is - "the enemy of your enemy was \nnever, is never and will never be your friend".'
p53
aS'Thor is gay'
p54
aS"I'm sorry but this movie was terrible! I personally loved it when they were \nin Asguard without any of the human characters, because it had a good tone! \nBut the human characters ruined the movie for me, they were way too cheesy \nand unrealistic. The first one was much better!"
p55
aS'Good movie '
p56
aS'The Raid 2 Teaser still better'
p57
aS"@wolves44445 Let you tell it. You couldn't even get on youtube and say \nsomething interesting. So anything you say is invalid. Go finish playin \nwith ya legos kid,that's about all you can handle,if even that."
p58
aS"I didn't quite understood at the end of the movie. What happened to loki is \nhe alive? Where is Odin?"
p59
aS"I just saw it and it was pretty good. But as a DC fan, I'm a little \nperturbed. Marvel already has three movies lined up for next year. X-Men: \nDays of Future's Past, Captain America: Winter Soldier, and The Avengers: \nAge of Ultron, although I think that's coming in two years. Where's DC in \nall this? I know they've got a Superman/Batman movie in development, but \nthere has to be more."
p60
aS'I am not joking. This is the best Marvel movie that I have ever watched \nyet. Better than The Avengers in my opinion although they are both cool. \nThor is way stronger and Loki is more funny and uses his powers more often \nin this film. I hope The Amazing Spider-man 2 will be awesome as well!'
p61
aS'Hee look like a bered bitch'
p62
aS"@marcaus park No one asked yours either,so now what? take a nap kid. It's a \ncritique. I know your not aware of it,but they are legal in the States. \nIt's an observation,settle down. If it's not watched,it can't be \nascertained if it would be liked. Your a cluck head,I know,and you couldn't \nfigure that out.  Now keep quiet so the thousands that have seen your \ninfantile rant,won't know that your i.q. is below 2"
p63
aS'I watched this yesterday with my friends! IT WAS SO AMAZING!!! I was \nfangirling for three hours afterward. :) I wanted to see the post-credits \nscene, but no one else did.'
p64
aS'Uitativa'
p65
aS"Okay so I just got home from seeing this movie at the theater so here is my \ntake on it and don't worry, no spoilers. It was quite rushed, it really \nshould have been three hours instead of two so that they could have had \nmore time to develop the story a little more however the high amount of \nhumor greatly helped to ease the pain of the rushed story line. I enjoyed \nit, a lot of fun and action and insanity which made it very entertaining my \nonly big problem, like I said, was the rushed feeling of it. Everything \nhappened a little too but I still highly suggest watching it! Btw keep \nwatching once the movie ends because there is an extra scene after the end \ncredits!"
p66
aS'great movie i loved it'
p67
aS'Does anyone know the song that Jane has as her ringtone?'
