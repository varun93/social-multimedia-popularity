S"it's really funny ,, nice movie\nAdam Sandler , is amazing actor"
p1
aS'Movie Africa = FUN\n\nReal Africa = Ebola, Malaria and all the diseases you can think of.\n\nI\'d visit for the culture, not because some movie claims "Africa is always \nlike this".'
p2
aS"1:45 the song is The Mowgli's - Say It, Just Say It :)"
p3
aS"I need some feedback. Is this movie good? We might see it in theaters and I \ndon't wanna watch it if It sucks."
p4
aS"Isn't that the same women from 50 Dates?"
p5
aS'Hate it when people treat africa like one big country, you cant just say im \ngoing to africa THERES 54 COUNTRIES IN AFRICA. You wouldnt say im going to \nAsia or Europe you would say what country'
p6
aS'These are the best Adam Sandler movies ever made in no particular order:\n\n1.) Happy Gilmore \n2.) The Water Boy\n3.) Anger Management\n4.) Billy Madison\n5.) Click\n6.) The Longest Yard\n7.) Big Daddy\n8.) The Wedding Singer'
p7
aS"I loved this movie , real funny and relaxing , excepts few weird moments \nlike when a kid like six yrs old uses the word vagina , I can't accept that \nin any context."
p8
aS"It's shit, just like every other Sandler film these days."
p9
aS"I hate the way that movies portray South Africa. It isn't just one big \nsafari! South Africa is one of the most gorgeous places in the world. And \nthere isn't just black people in south Africa. We are do diverse. Plus sun \ncity doesn't have weird tribal rooms and funky singers and wild animals \nroaming around! It is a beautiful resort and this is a beautiful country! \nPeople should stop treating us like we're done kind of freak show"
p10
aS'lol cant wait to see it'

p17
aS"Terry Crew and the music band didn't make this film any better, they only \nworsened it."
p18
aS'I went to see this, I have to say hilarious'
p19
aS"I love Adam Sandler's movies so quit your bitching and go find a genre you \nlike instead of insulting this guys career. If he likes doing it and people \nwatch it who cares."
p20
aS'first time the trailer is much worse than the movie :) first movie with \nSandler I really liked and gonna recommend to everybody, nice comedy, very \nfunny.'
p21
aS"Okay, i am sick and tiered of Hollywood referring to Africa like it's a \ncounty. WHERE IN AFRICA MOTHERFUCKER, WHERE??\nZIMBABWE, ZAMBIA, KENYA, SOUTH AFRICA, 54 GOD DAMN COUNTRIES AND YOU JUST \nSAY AFRICA...... sweet and sour chicken i am sick of this. "
p22

p25
aS'You know, for an Adam Sandler movie this was impressive. Although the plot \nis very cheesy and predictable, I actually enjoyed a few parts here and \nthere. I would give it about a 6 or 7 out of 10'
p26
aS'This looks poop'
p27
aS'Looks shit. \n\nSame movie as always, they end up with each other and everyone goes home \nhappy ever after. Adam Sandler used to be funny now its just boring.\n\nWhy do they not make an actual good movie at Happy Madison and not the same \nmovie over and over again.'
p28
aS"It's so amazing to watch Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler 10 years later in \nanother movie together. Still 50 first days (2004)  is one of the best \nmovies I've ever watched, but this one looks great too."

p71
aS'Interesting fact, Africa is actually not a very "pretty" place. My family \nmoved to Uganda from Russia and its not exactly nice here.Most african \ncountries aren\'t AT ALL how you picture them. When I heard we were moving, \nI pictured a safari-filled life full of exotic food and adventure, but you \nonly live like that if you\'re rich and have a firm job in a country where \ngovernment isn\'t denying you pay. So sure, Africa has scenery (in the \nvillages) but most cities are polluted, dirty & dangerous.'

aS'2014th comment'

aS'Get reayd to see yet another film from adam shitler who goes on a vacation \nto spend a shit load of money with his kids while you waste yours in a 2 \nhour boring film.

aS"Ok I want even Redbox another Adam Sandler movie he isn't funny and would \nbe waste of my time. I haven't liked him since I was 9. He expects the \naudience to still like his fart humor after twenty years. Also is it me or \ndoes Drew Barrymore play pretty much the same character in everything. OK \nthis how this goes he will be a selfless jerk who no one likes. She will be \na innocent mother who tries her best to do good for her family. They meet \neach other an instantly don't like each other. Something happens to where \nthey get stuck with each other where they fall in love. The end. No need to \nhear the stale jokes and corny punchlines. "
