p2
aS'Whats the name if the song in 1:31 ??'
p3
aS"I just don't get how people found insidious 1 and 2 extremely scary? my 12 \nyear old sister and I watched both of them in one night and we didn't even \nget that scared. ok well i admit in insidious 1 where you see the demon he \nkinda scared me, but my little sister never even moved. the conjuring and \ninsidious was her first scary movies. maybe it is actually really scary or \nmy sister is REALLY good at watching scary movies. lol"

aS'insidious 2 Official Trailer 2013\n( This film is a ok film )'
p8
aS"I do not understand. How is this chapter 2 connected to the first movie ? \nat the end of the first movie Josh returns from the astral plan possessed \nby an evil spirit. He killed Elise . I do not understand why the 2nd \nchapter is taking place. How did he got rid of the evil spirit within him ? \nHow was Elise's death handled??"
p9
aS'Oh shit this came out on my birthday '
p10
aS"Thought the film was OK but was very derivative.  I guess the director was \nbanking on the fact that most of the younger audience wouldn't remember the \noriginal films he nicked some of the ideas from.  Worth watching though."
p11
aS"this movies remembers me The Sentinel from the 70's."
p12
aS'SPOILER!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you pay attention... The girl that runs out of the closet screaming \n"HELP"when dalton was in bed, that was Allison. (Aka.. The girl at the very \nend) '
p13
aS"Thomas Bangalter's score used in the trailer is just gorgeous and \ndisorientating. "
p14
aS'I think Insidious 2 is just as good as the first one. I was really \nimpressed by the twists in this sequel.'
p15
aS'incidious 2 one of the kind'
p16
aS"Wo can help me, i need the song at the end of the trailer, i can't find \nthat on the official Ost..."
p17
aS'I like both, Butler is better the first'
p18
aS"When will these movie producers learn to properly balance the speech and \neffect sounds.. Actors mumble some stuff so silently to force you to turn \nthe volume all the way up, probably so they can use a chea scare tactic by \nusing a loud noise or a sound cue. Pathetic. That's a tactic for 9-year \nolds for fuck's sake.\n\nIt's like, I want to hear the story and understand it, but I don't want my \nears blown off every time a BOO! GET SCARED! scene comes up. We're in 2014 \nand they can't do sound properly. I could teach a street bum how to do it, \nand the sad part is that I'm not even joking about that. Whoever was in \ncharge of sound, put on an apron, and go flip some burgers. Put your skills \nto a proper use."
p19
aS'Watch the trailer of dabbe zehri cin, thats a horror movie!'
p20

p25
aS'I like both, Butler is better the first'
p26
aS"This movie didn't scare me ... kind of let down tbh "
p27

p28
aS'whats the name if the song in 0:01'
p29
aS'I like the movie because it actually has a plot. A lot of scary movies \nconsist of mainly jump scares to make up for the lack of story. But this \nfilm actually has a story line.'

p35
aS"Is the sequel at least better than the first? Sorry to offend anyone but \nI'm allowed to express my opinions and I felt there was nothing scary about \nthe first one besides one or two cheap jumpscares. Wish hollywood would \ncome out with something that could get under my skin"

aS"It's a continue from the 1st but even more scarier I can see a chapter 3 \ncoming soon I love this movie so much "
p40
aS"They really didn't need to do this movie. Why does hollywood feel the need \nto make sequels?\nI saw this movie anyway and all I felt was Meh. unnecessary jump scares \nwith an almost believable story line and an crappy ending plus it felt \nrushed. "
p41
