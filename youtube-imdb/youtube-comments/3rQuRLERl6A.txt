p5
aS'I have to like look for this movie now'
p6
aS'Marion Crane dies very early in the book so when Mirren says in the trailer \nthat he should kill her off early and not half way through like it was her \nidea is not accurate.\n\nMaybe they were creating a surprising moment for the audience to give the \ntrailer an extra kick.'

p28
aS"Woodkid - Iron ....you'll know it from Assassin's Creed Revelation Cinematic"
p29
aS"I never really fully appreciated Hopkin's talent until I saw Nixon. There \nis something mesmerizing about the way in which he protrays actual \nhistorical figures of whom we have a fully animated picture in our \ncollective consciousness. It feels like a kind of weird double bluff. At \nfirst you feel like he completely gets it wrong. And then you suddenly \nrealise you forgot Hopkins had anything to do with the movie and you have \nto blink in order to see it's him and not the real character!"
p30
aS'What so entertaining life you must have to call this "boring"'
p31
aS'fuck this movie'
p32
aS"Just going to say this now, I don't mean it rude etc as I am a HUGE fan of \nHitchcock. I studied him a while back and came to the conclusion he is \nhuman. He likes the thought of murder, necrophilia, sex, boobs, violence, \nmystery, thriller. He is a human. But he is a VERY smart one. I hope you \ncan understand that not every film will take all these pointers but they \nwill take what they can and blow it out of proportion"
