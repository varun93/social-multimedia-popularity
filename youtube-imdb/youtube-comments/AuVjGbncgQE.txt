I pray to Hazel every night, thanking her \nfor the life I have been given "Hazel is love", I say, "Hazel is life" My \nfriend hears me and calls me a faggot. He is obviously jealous of my \ndevotion to Hazel. I called him a cunt. He slaps me and sends me to my \nroom. I am crying now and my face hurts. I go into bed and it is very cold. \nI feel a warmth moving towards me. Its hazel! \nI am so happy. She whispers in my ear "alright lungs keep your shit \ntogether" she grabs me with her cold de-oxygenated hands and puts me on the \nbed. Then she leaves through the window. \nHazel is love\nHazel is life'
