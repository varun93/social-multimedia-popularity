S'I watched this because I read comments that it was like "Joe".  Although \nthere are some similarities, and this movie is good, I think "Joe" is much \nbetter.  More importantly, I also think Tye Sheridan is the greatest up and \ncoming young actor out there right now.  A kid who walks in big man\'s \nshoes.  He has a walk and a talk that seems beyond the experiences of his \nyears.  I see a great future for him in film, and I sure hope Hollywood \ndoesn\'t taint what seems to come naturally from him.\nI love the final shot of this film... made me want to take a boat ride in \nsearch of a scene like that.'

p19
aS'Trailer dosnt do it justice'
p20
aS"the movie was so unique I thought. I think this trailer doesn't illustrate \nthe movie correctly.. It's more of an adventure and mystery movie from a \nteenagers perspective rather than a thriller/action "

p30
aS'i couldnt help but think of "My name is Mud" by Primus. '
p31
aS'One of the TOP three movies I\'ve ever watched. Brave Heart and Gross Point \nBlank being the other two. I know it\'s slow but it\'s not long. There is a \ndifference between boringly long and an intentional slow burn. This took \nawhile to start but once I was hooked, I loved the fate of the characters \nso much I did not want their stories to end. That is a sign of a good \nmovie. I put on productions for a living and rule # 1 "Always leave the \naudience wanting more". For example; I really liked American Hustle. Good \ndamn flick. But I just wanted it to be over about 30 minutes before it was. \nPeople can\'t always express why, or what  they liked or disliked about a \nmovie. They just place it on an overall echelon. So taking all the little \ngrips out below, this encompasses all the elements of a magnificent film. \nI\'m not looking for a debate. It\'s just my opinion. Take it or leave it. \n(but I am a graduate from film school and own a theatre).'

p37
aS'After watching MUD, i can assume you this is the worst movie ever. Do not \nwatch this, ore be warned!'
p38
aS'Looking over the comments, I\'m wondering how some of you raved about this \nfilm as if it were "The Film" to watch. \n\nIt was an enjoyable watch though.'
p39
aS"I dress in blue yes navy blue from head to toe I'm rather drab except my \npatent leather shoes\n\nI make 'em shine\n\nMost the time"
p40
aS'should I watch this one ?'
p41
aS'Well folks, u GOT to see this movie. Decent, heartwarming and very well \nscripted coming of age story with an incredible well playing cast. I guess, \nTye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland are about to be seen much more often.'

aS'Matt Mcconaughey... Been a fan ever since "Frailty". He\'s an awesome actor. \nOnly idiots would judge him by his heartthrob/romcom-ness alone. Clearly \nthat\'s all they\'ve ever seen him act in. '
