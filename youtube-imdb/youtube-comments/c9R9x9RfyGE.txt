S"Just watched it and, wonderful movie!\nAll the characters are loveable, the plot is awesome, it's a hilarious \nmovies overall and just... yes. Needs more fans."
p1
aS"The color scheme and similarity of certain elements of the main character's \ndesign do make it look like a HTTYD ripoff, but if it were one, it would \nprobably have a title that sounded similar enough to get old grannies to \naccidentally buy it for their kids. Don't know though, haven't seen it."
p2
aS'Brave and HTTYD rip off!!!!!!!'
p3
aS'Uauu! Greaaaaat!\nA Joseph Campbell Hero jorney, I (Uauu) VERY happy with the overall result!\nLots of fun!\nA MUST WATCH!\n\nMAMA MIA\nAll the Best'
p4
aS"just watched this earlier// .it's nothing like How to train a dragon \nactually. its nice, hillarious, epic even.. its got originality and had a \nvery good moral lesson. :))"
p5
aS"At first it didn't look bad, till it straight up stole scenes from Httyd. (\n1:07-1:11 rip off of Hiccup and Toothless's flight scene)"
p6
aS"this is a rip off of httyd!!!! I'm insulted"
p7
aS'Justin & The Knights of Valour was a very, very nice surprise.\nAltough the animation lacks a little "finesse", I really liked the \nmodeling, the colors and the moods. All sets were very fantasy-like with a \ntouch of "je ne sais quois"... A really wonderful universe.\nNice story with a happy ending. Recommended for the entire family.\n#movies   #cgi   #justin   #knightsofvalour  '
p8
aS"I gotta say, how come I've never got to see this movie on theaters?"
p9
aS"CGI is decent, but did they really have to rip off HTTYD? There are exact \nframe for frame rip offs of the favorable flight scene involving Toothless \nand Hiccup. I don't see why people make rip offs in the first place. They \noften have horrible CGI moments, cruddy voice actors and badly laid \nscripts. Just don't waste the money in the first place.. Logic. "
p10
aS'The Dragon is epic'
p11
aS'i thought this was a rip-off from httyd but it has no similarties at \nall....loved the movie,it was really great :)'

p17
aS"1:06 TOTALLY DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ANOTHER MOVIE ABOUT FLYING AND TRAINING \nDRAGONS"
p18
aS'Is he supposed to be the kid of Merida and Hiccup?\nAnyways, looks like a rip off of How To Train Your Dragon. Not watching'
p19
aS'This looks very good!'
p20
aS"Who else noticed the How to train your dragon referance when him and the \n'dragon' were falling? XD Justin looks ALOT like Hiccup needless to say"

aS"I haven't heard this movie before.... but if anyone wants to watch it here \nhttp://viooz.co/movies/23195-justin-and-the-knights-of-valour-2013.html \n.What confuses me is that people are comparing it to how to train your \ndragon. Like seriously? an alligator is not a dragon. "
p41
aS'People keep saying this is "how to train your dragon" so this movie is \nabout "how to train your dragon" let\'s leave it at that.'

p46
aS"Doesn't this guy look like the dude from ratatouille seriously"
p47
aS"So today i saw this movie and i was shocked! This movie is so full of \nsatanic symbolism! I mean that sorcerer or something is definitely devil's \nworshipper! The pentagram, third eye, triangles, 666, getting power from \nsomething unknown, talking with the evil side... THE DEVIL! That's only how \ni can explain it... In Cloudy with a chance of meatballs 2 at least they \nfought with the evil and in this movie he's just helps them reach their \ngoal and is a friend!!! The illuminati is brainwashing nowadays' kids and \nother people doesn't care about it! Please share this with other people so \nwe can win this fight with the illuminati, even if you're an atheist. Thank \nyou for the time you gave me."
p48
aS'Linguini!!'
p49
aS"Stop saying its a HTTYD rip off. I've watched this movie before and there \nis NOTHING in it that rips off HTTYD. \n\nThe movie is about how this kid goes and pursues to become a true KNIGHT. \nThat's it that's the main plot.\n\nBtw that is an Alligator/Crocodile, he was used as a test subject for \nJustin to practice his skills. Watch the darn movie and ya'll will see the \ndifference."

p56
aS"It's like Hiccup and Linguini had a love child."
p57
aS"Guys, shuddup. This movie is nothing like How to Train Your Dragon. It's \nCOMPLETELY different! The only relation they have, is there are both grumpy \ndads, and ruthless women that the main character fall in love with. \nIf you haven't seen it, DON'T judge it. \nBecause it just makes you look stupid."
