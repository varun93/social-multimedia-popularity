p77
aS"those that have seen the movie will know what i'm saying. but without \ngiving it away, does anyone else think a certain someone getting a certain \nsomething inserted into his certain something on his neck after that smile \nis one of the most hilarious scenes in recent film? i just can't get past \nhow funny it is. then when a certain someone comes back in the room and \ndoes the roll, i just die. "
p78
aS"@pirate1guy you're not wrong. i guess i just got more of a cia/sex and \nadultery/bumbling idiots theme but your take is right there with that. i \nthink the most important scenes in the movie are the very first and very \nlast. the shots of the satellite zooming in and out of the earth. with \nsatellites like that (which exist, many of them) there is absolutely no \nneed for the officials portrayed in the movie to have a job. but they still \ndo, and do stupid things. all in all it's very funny.

aS'@sk8terGrlM LOOOOOL dude ur so funny :P.'
p94
aS"what's the name of the song in the trailer?"
p95
aS"@mataCwaeh Good eye! He is. As you probably know, in the movie, the gun \nhe's holding is quite visible. My guess is that because trailers for movies \nhave to be circulated and approved for all audiences that the gun was \nremoved digitally so that a character wouldn't be shown holding a gun in \none hand and an alcoholic beverage in the other."
p96
aS'Awesome movie Awesome trailer Awesome music'
