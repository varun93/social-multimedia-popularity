aS'True Grit Theatrical Trailer Official (HD)'
p2
aS"Wow this trailer is terrible! This is by far my favorite movie. Just can't \ndo it justice I guess."
p3
aS'When I think about a culturally important tradition for myself and many \nAmericans, I think of the old Westerns. Starring American icons such as \nJohn Wayne and Clint Eastwood. However, the Western genre is anything but \nan accurate depiction of The West that was the reality of the 19th century. \n"A simulation is an idealized representation of an idea, in which the \nrepresentation slowly becomes more accepted than reality" (Peterson 2014).\n\nJohn Wayne always made the west appear as a battle of morals, the good \nlawmen or ranchers would face off against the evil Indians or outlaws in a \ntriumphant battle that good would eventually win. Viewers in the 1960\'s \nstarted to see our history of the west as just this; a very dangerous land \nfilled with bad men who wanted to do bad things, but a few brave people \nusing grit, talent, and innovation made it clean and safe for everybody \nelse. \n\nHowever, this is pretty far from the truth. The westerns always play up the \nuntamed nature of the West, and its great danger. But by far the greatest \ndangers to settlers were dysentery, cholera, and other diseases (slightly \nless dramatic adversity). Many of the Native Americans, if we did accurate \nrepresentations of what occurred, would be seen as "good guys", as they \nwere usually the underdogs, trying to defend their homes and way of life. \nWomen (who are almost never portrayed, and if so as devoted wives that love \ntheir lives and their husbands, who scream when anything bad happens) \nplayed a much more active role than is portrayed, and oftentimes suffered \nthe most in the lonely ranches that sprung up throughout the frontier.\n\nBut American audiences do not want to see what actually happened, they have \nan idea in their head of what the west was like, in all of it\'s coolness \nand glory, and that is what they want to see when they turn on their \ntelevisions. A section of escapism, to a time and place when your strength \nand quickness to draw determined if you brought home the beautiful girl. \nHowever, on the (in my own opinion) plus side, moderns have been shifting \naway from the simplistic dualism of the 1950\'s and 1960\'s, to a world where \ngood does not always triumph, boundaries between good and evil are not \nalways so clear, and women can play a large role. \n\nBelow is a link to the trailer for the modern remake of True Grit, an \namazing movie, and a good demonstration of the mix between classic (justice \nthrough guns) western and new (strong female characters) western.'
p4
aS"Best part is when Jeff Bridges says-Them there boys,gonna think about the \nwrath that's gonna be sit down on them."
p5
aS'In my opinion,Jeff Bridges does this movie better justice than John Wayne.'
p6
aS'Nobody plays Rooster Cogburn better then John Wayne, but Jeff bridges done \npretty good.'
p7
aS'Trashy trailer for a beautiful film. '
p8
aS'Bbc two at 9! Gonna check it out! '
p9

p15
aS'Music at 0:23 ? :)!! '
p16
aS'Johnny Cash off of American V: A Hundred Highways'
p17
aS'One of the greatest movies I have ever seen. kills Django any day every way.'
p18
aS"Movies like these need more than one viewing to be appreciated, as is Edge \nof Darkness (very different movie and the trailer leading us to believe \nit's boom boom safe)"
p19
aS'badass trailer'
p20
aS"Best movie to come out of 2010, and 2010 was a good year for movies. Also, \nyou can now add Academy Award Nominee next to Hailee Steifeld's name (even \nthough they so rudely didn't mention her when she was arguably the main \ncharacter.)"
p21
aS"what's the song in this trailer ?"
p22
aS'Jeff Bridges won best Actor for this movie '
p23

p25
aS'Did i just see a bear in a horse? 2:02 Lol'
p26
aS'@citizenjamie Yeah, I feel pretty stupid I never caught that when I saw the \ntrailer the first time.'

p29
aS'What is the song at 1:22?'
p30
aS'red dead redemption'
p31
aS"It's kinda sad that it took a ponified version of this trailer to bring me \nhere. Still, I'm glad it did. Otherwise I would never have found this \nwonderful movie."
p32
aS'run on by johnny cash'
p33
aS'Check that- 1:51. '
p34
aS'id watch it on netflix first and then make a choice '
p35
aS'I can die now, because I read an entire book worth of arguementive \nmaterial. Nice grammar. '
p36
aS"Is this argument still going on? It's been going on for 6 comment pages!"
p37
aS':22 - :42'
p38
aS'just came here for the awesome trailer song. '
p39
aS"This is an awesome trailer but i thought it sent out the wrong message, as \nin not masses of action, but still an awesome movie! I also think that i \nwould have enjoyed this movie better if it had subtitles as al lot of it \nwas dialogue and most the time i couldn't understand a word bridges and \ndamon was saying, probably cuz they were doing such good western voices!"
p40
aS'Brilliant Film, but never will it be as good as the original... we love the \nduke !'
p41
aS'thanks'
p42
aS'my dad made me see this'
p43
aS"God's gonna cut you down"
p44
aS"Does anyone know the FIRST song used in the trailer? Not Johnny cash's \ntrack."
p45
aS"But I'm just the dude... man."
p46
aS'What is the name of the song in the beginning? '
p47
aS"Thank you for your reply, zmackey0, I understand it's not for everyone just \na tad extreme. The Mist is an excellent King adaptation but the ending is \nnot as gruesome as a child losing an arm - visually they handled it better \nsomehow even though he shot the entire family but they didn't show me the \nkid's brains being blown out or him surviving and walking with a metal \nplate. It's not what this trailer conveys - this trailer = it's safe cuz \nJeff's on the case and Jeff's the man not spanking girls"
p48
aS'One of the BEST REMAKES EVER!!!!!!!!'
p49

p51
aS'One of the BEST REMAKES EVER!!!!!!!!'
p52
aS'The movie depicted in this trailer is a movie I\'d like to see. Unfortunetly \nthe move titled "True Grit 2010" that I rented was not the movie depicted \nin this trailer. It wasn\'t the worst movie I\'d ever seen but it was \ndefinetly a big disappointment.'
p53
aS'Great movie!'
p54
aS'Why would it be???? this was her breakthrough performance. Its fairly \ncommon in movies. This is not new. Pay attention. '
p55
aS"44 people don't have a true grit in their genes"
p56
aS"@MrTruthBeTold51 you tell me to be a man??? why don't you get a life??? at \nleast I'm smart enough to look up some information before ripping \nfilmmakers to pieces unlike you, you ignorant douchebag!!! "
p57
aS"One of the best remakes I've seen. The Duke is still the one and only, but \nJeff did a pretty good job to make a John Wayne fan happy."
p58
aS"@stirlingsheep i'm guessing u dont know whats the first song?"
p59
aS"the movie was awesome. the book was better. But I've watched that trailer \nat least ten times. amazing"
p60
aS'This movie sucked!!!! Dont watch it, it was really boring'
p61
aS"Agreed. I've probably viewed True Grit and No Country at least 3 times \neach. I had nearly forgotten about Edge of Darkness. Also a great movie! \nI'll have to watch that one again sometime this week. "
p62
aS'When No Country first came out I was absolutely appalled by the ending. It \nwas, until the point when the main protagonist is killed off camera, the \nmost amazing movie I had ever seen. It took me a very long time to \nunderstand that we, as the audience, are not owed anything. I came to the \nrealization that, much like real life, we do not always receive the outcome \nwe want, nor the one we feel we deserve. When I accepted that, I found an \nappreciation for their masterpieces just as they are.'
p63
aS'Open Range (2003) & Broken Trail (2006) & 3:10 to Yuma (2007) were \nexcellent movies, but True Grit (2010) is without question, the best \nWestern since Unforgiven (1992). It\'s also a rare instance when a remake is \nas good, or (arguably) even better than the original. That says a lot, \nespecially coming from a huge fan of "The Duke". The Coen brothers are \namazing filmmakers & national treasures! I\'ve seen & love nearly all their \nmovies. I eagerly await any & all of their upcoming projects.'
p64
aS'JOHN WAYNE-TRUE GRIT. JEFF BRIDGES-MICRO GRIT.'
p65
aS'What song is that ?'
p66
aS'They should make Cogburn a character in the next Red dead redemption. \nThumbs up if you agree.'
p67
aS"What's the name of the song that starts at 1:21?"
p68
aS'Johnny Cash makes this so much better'
p69
aS"Travesty! NOBODY should be allowed to TRY and fill John Wayne's boots...and \nJeff Bridges doesn't even come close...This was a disgrace to The Duke's \nmemory and I didn't even watch the film...just the trailer..the Cohen \nbrothers should be embarrassed and ashamed for even thinking about doing \nthis...."
p70
aS"It's a raw idea that I had. I know it has its plot holes and cliches. I'm \nwell aware that slavery was abolished in 1864, I was just debating whether \nor not it would take place during or after slavery."
p71

aS'Jonny cash: GOD IS GONNA CUT YOU DOWN'
p78
aS'John Wayne was such a subpar actor that any Academy Award nominee nowadays \ncan out act him. Jeff Bridges gave an incredible performance, and as much \nas I enjoy the 1969 version of True Grit, the 2010 version was just better.'
p79
aS"I'm 58 and Wayne's performance is still fresh in MY mind, but maybe I just \nhave a good memory (I'm not wearing plaid pants and white patent leather \nshoes yet). But damn, as great as the Duke was, Jeff Bridges trumped John \nWayne, and Matt Damon trumped Glen Campbell. This was way better than the \noriginal. A great movie and great performance."
p80
aS'agreed'
p81
aS'I do like the original but its hard to compete with the remake.'
p82
aS'The song is gods ganna cut you down by Johnny Cash :)'
p83
aS'Just saw the movie! Wow! What was those 2 songs that sound similar?'
p84
aS'2:01 a bear? or an indian?'
p85
aS'Poor Moon.'
p86
aS'After I saw Django, I started playing my GUN game again:)'
p87
aS"@eddycatflap Both movies were based on a novel. This movie is an adaptation \nof the novel, not a remake of the previous adaptation. This movie follows \nthe book more closely than the previous. So, what I have said just dulled, \nnullified, and superfluized your comment. (Douchey laugh) Yeah I'm a total \ndouche. And pretentious, too."
p88
aS'Yep he dose\\/'
p89
aS'This comments section is in dire need of an artillery barrage.'
p90
aS'i hate ads on youtube.'
p91
aS'Hey shut the hell up about the movie theater massacre prick. What a low \nlife you are to make fun of such a tragedy. Grow up.'
p92
aS'Truly shit ...'
p93
aS'Hailee Steinfeld is so god damn beautiful!'
p94
aS'@MRLoquendo1990 stupid juden !!!! '
p95
aS"I hate how they made it seem at the end of the trailer like Marshall \nCogburn shot the wounded criminal. I hate that these movie trailers aren't \nmade by the directiors. People who have nothing to do with films churn \nthese things out with no regard for the film. Just by adding a gunshot \nsound they completely warped expectations for the character and the film. \nOne day I want a director to use advertising cleverly, like make it seem \nlike its a frat film in the commercials, then 30m in BOOM! Zombies"
p96
aS'.... dont watch this!! WAAAYY TOO REVEALING!!!! unless you have already \nseen it, then its amazing'
