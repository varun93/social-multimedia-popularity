S'"The Chef" is a wonderful family movie.\nIt has two things I think make it worth you\'re while. One is the fact that \nit doesn\'t demonize social media/networks. Too often we see movies where \ntwitter, facebook, are linked with stalking, bullying, nerds, gender \nprofiling and all the negatives. But not this one. It provides a good \ninsight on how they \'actually\' work and give a little taste of the pros and \ncons of using them.\nSpeaking of taste, we come to the second one. Food! Worldwide we are all \ngetting fat, and many times is because we don\'t know what we eat, or worse, \nwe don\'t care. In this movie we see an effort into getting people \n(specially young people) thinking, and even apreciating, what we intake in \nour bodies...and how good it is. Throw some latin music, Johanson and \nDowney Jr., to taste, and voil!\nAll in all, a funny and entertaing movie that everyone can enjoy on a \nsaturday afternoon. Recommended!'

aS'DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.\nCliche filled, basic, superficial plot, unreal characters you have seen a \nthousand times before in hollywood films, unoriginal themes... If you just \nwant to spend time and you have nothing else to do, go see this. If you are \ninterested in the art behind filmography, go watch Aguirre, the wrath of \ngod.'
p41
aS'LOL can you imagine if this was an Iron Man AU? someone recast the rest of \nthe characters with other Avengers actors :P'
p42
aS"This movie is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. If you haven't \nseen it yet, then I don't really know what you're doing with your life."

p67
aS'Where is J.A.R.V.I.S?'
p68
aS'I laugh at some comments like "They\'re in too many movies" or "they\'re \nrecycling the cast". I\'m like... you do realize that actors need to act to \nsurvive, right? That just because you saw on in a big franchise doesn\'t \nmean they\'re gonna stop doing other projects right? '
p69
aS"can't wait :):)"
p70
aS"Where's chef Ramsey? "
p71
aS'I really enjoyed "Big Night" --I kind of see bits of that in this - an \nhomage to food -  and while this seems more of a comedy than that, and with \nwhat appears to be scores of cameo bit roles to major stars, this really \ndoes appear to be more of a Jon Favreau joint than it is a venue for "Tony \nStark" or any ScarJo showcase (I\'ve seen "Under The Skin" - how creepy!). \nSo I find it kind of disingenuous that they mention those 2 names in the \nclip title. They don\'t care, I s\'pose. They just want people to view the \ntrailer, even if they misrepresent it. The only thing that bothers me, is \nthe low class jerks who find it necessary with their comments to disrespect \nall women by talking about Scarlett Johansson like she\'s a sex object not \nin a flattering way, but in a repulsive way.'
p72
aS"don't try the food you shitting for weeks"
p73
aS"Now I'm hungry."
p74
aS'movie night in order'
p75

p80
aS'Anyone know the main song to this trailer?'
p81
aS"what's the name of the song that starts at 0:35? with the base "
p82
aS"The smashing sequel to Under Lucy's Skin, starring the unforgettable \nperformance of Scarlett Johansson as a genetically superior femme fatale \nfrom outer space who devours hitch hikers. SPOILER: Morgan Freeman narrates \nhimself into a coma. He emerges with the recipe for her cure, which turns \nher into a harmless human. Chef takes place 4 years later as she tries to \nassume a role of earthling normalcy as a delicate, attractive woman, albeit \nin the background, even though she's the thumbnail to gain more views."
p83
aS'Fat America gets the movie that Hollywood thinks we deserve.\nYou fat Americans have the right to choose the foods you eat, and if anyone \ntries to take away that right, immigrant tacos will save you.'
p84
aS'I have never seen a movie better than the trailer.'

aS'this looks good'
p90
aS'... I like food'
p91
aS'This movie looks so convoluted and retarded. cant wait to not see it.'
p92
aS'@ 1:10 is this a new thing now just show what people text in the air \ninstead on showing the actual texting device!? I mean what happened to just \nshowing the actual device and what they were texting? No they have to show \nit just floating in mid air..... imagine some comedy where some random \nperson walks into some random text. and gets hit in the face. Just \nsaying...'
