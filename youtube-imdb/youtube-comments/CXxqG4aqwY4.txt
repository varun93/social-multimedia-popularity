S'Watched this today on Bigpond Movies. \n\nGood movie, really funny (Family Guy Humour),  Seth was great, Charlize \nmore gorgeous than ever.  '
p1
aS'2:49 on the left was that orlando bloom?'
p2
aS"Watching this movie was really painful. I tried so hard to laugh at the \njokes but meh.. Idk if its the bad acting or the generic jokes..but it \nreally didn't work for me."
p3
aS'This trailer is fake. Mila Kunis is not a language.'
p4
aS'I saw zero black people in this trailer.........MacFarlane, why?'
p5
aS"It's like Family Guy with real actors"
p6
aS'you americans are real good at making a Trailer but realy bad at making a \nmovie >:('
p7
aS'Im gonna go see this movie for my first ever date ,and im 20 thumbs up if \nyou wish me luck :)'
p8
aS"Haven't laughed so hard in ages and that's saying a lot from yank humour.\nMonty Python still the best humour going.....had to add that.\nI'll bet the cast had trouble keeping a straight face half the time.\nAt least I could sit through it without getting bored which is more than I \ncan say for a few other new ones I've seen lately."
p9
aS"This movie sucked.  Don't waste your money.  If you HAVE to see it, wait \nfor it to hit red box or Netflix. "
p10
aS'Charlize Theron all the way! I like her a lot.'
p11
aS"Does anyone else have a huge crush on Seth? I mean, he's hilarious, \nintelligent, talented, and so sexy! :D"
p12
aS'"A million Ways to Die in the West" could be good if Seth MacFarlane only \ndid the voice.'
p13
aS'another big pile of shit from Seth'
p14
aS"Oh this looks like a fuckin awesome movie! A big handful of my favorite \nactors too, that's not something that happens very often."
p15
aS'2:11 Did he say Mila Kunis? '
p16
aS'The main guy sounds like Brian from family guy. '
p17
aS'i think i would have laughend when i was 11.'
p18
aS'self indulgent piece of shit. dialogue was generic and jokes were painful \nto watch.'
p19
aS'this movie is so racist toward black people. throughout the whole movie \nthere was barely a black person in it except for the very end and that was \njust a cameo appearance of Jamie fox as django. there was even a point in \nthe movie where they had a game at the state fair called shoot the runaway \nslave. Seth MacFarlane is a racist asshole and the movie sucked.'
p20
aS'So funny!'
p21
aS"In the movie Theron said I have great tits I question what fits and her \npotty mouth continuously was uncalled for.\nAnd pot cookies I believe the term pot wasn't used in that era. "
p22
aS'I think this was funny because of my dark mind....'
p23

p28
aS'I loved the movie, had a good time with a light hearted fun movie.'
p29
aS'"1000 Ways to Die in the West" has a long title and it is pretty funny. \nUnfortunatelly it doesn\'t deliver everything... At lest, not right until \nthe very end anyway. Some nonsense, some crazy dialogue, some good editing, \nan underline romance, and lots of gags. So, a good entertainment for a \nweekend afternoon.'
p30
aS'It reminds of a 1000 ways to die.'
p31
aS"Punch lines dosn't Work and story line is weak! Thought it would be better \n:/"
p32
aS'mila kunis mila kunis'
p33
aS"I dislike because it offenses my religion which is ISLAM which means PEACE \n...\nat the end of the movie he starts making noises a loud voice  thinking that \nthis is how we recite Qura'an the Holly Book of Islam why would u offense a \nreligion it has nothing to do with comedy at all  ... Muslims never offense \nany religion actually we respect all of them ... why cant they just be open \nminded we don't make fun of ur bible when u read it and sing in the church \n!"
p34
aS'To William Smith, the uneducated antiracist fool who thinks that racism is \nokay when it doesn\'t come from white people (= definition of racism) and \nseems to think that only black people have suffered through History : you \nshould google the etymology of the word "slave" - believe me, it\'s for your \ngood. '

p36
aS'This looks like shit im sorry and what the hell is liam neeson doing here'
p37
aS'Coming to a theater near you *soon*'
p38
aS"I think the people that don't like this movie, don't like his beliefs, like \natheism, lefty politics, pro-environment, somewhat libertarian etc."
p39
aS"The 'Back To The Future' scene was cool..."
p40
aS'Jamie Foxx appearing as Django Freeman was epic!\n\n"People die at the fair..."'
p41
aS"Seth Macfarlane is nothing but an overconfident nerd who never should've \nbeen given a stage to spew his childish douchebag try-hard humor."
p42
aS"This movie is 99% about dick, ass, shit and fart jokes. Don't waste your \ntime watching this crap."

aS'A million ways to ruin a film career. (Seth MacFarlande edition...)'
p51
aS'At the end Albert says, his grandparents are Arabic!!!hahaha Arabic is a \nlanguage he probably meant Arab. And obviously if u are arab it doesnt mean \nu have to be a muslim, because only 39% arab are muslim in whole and rest \nof 61% are non-Arab muslim.

p58
aS'Once this turned into a love story it got really boring and slowed the pace \nof the movie.  The best part was the Back to the Future scene with Doc \nBrown fixing the DeLorean.  5/10 rating.'
p59
aS'seth macfarlanes brand of humor doesnt really translate well into movies'
p60

p67
aS'Did Seth said Mila Kunis when talking to the indians?'
p68
aS"this movie is extremely bad... I kinda like the family guy but this movie \nhas the worst sense of humor ever... It's not even stupid fun.. it's a \nmovie pushing itself to make you laugh that makes it worse than the worst \ncomedy on earth... so so miserable to see Charlize Theron or Liam Neeson in \nthis weird movie."
p69
aS'nothing in this trailer is funny.  how is "omg that went south so fast!" \nfunny?'
p70
aS"This movie is far beyond family guy can push its limit with TV so why not \nput it all out on the big screen with all the sex, racist jokes as \npossible, it made me laugh and watched it again. Don't watch this if you \ndon't have a sense of humor."
p71
aS'I LOVED THE MOVIE :D'
p72
aS'Best comedy movie of the year'
p73
aS'What is tha name of the song 0:20'
p74
aS'=))) epic.'
p75
aS"This trailer makes the movie look really good and funny. I only managed to \nwatch the first hour of it though because it was pretty dull and boring and \nI didn't really find the jokes that funny. I think they have literally just \nput every funny bit into this trailer so when you watch the movie there are \nno funny scenes that make you laugh because you've already seen them in the \ntrailer. "
p76
aS'all the good scenes were in the trailer ! thats all in this movie ! not \nthat good ! :('
p77
aS'Awesome!'
p78
aS'Liam Neeson was the only reason I watched it...seeing the Doc briefly was \nsure a surprise! :D'
p79
aS'I found a working link for this movie (streaming or download): \nhttp://www.linkbucks.com/ANGz5\nTo watch: Click, skip ads, watch the movie\nTo download: click, skip ads, copy the movie url to your download manager \nor built in browser downloader\nHappy watching! ;D'
p80
aS'Truthfully, this movie was lame, the jokes were bland and dry. Your better \nof watching Ted or Rango. Though Seth Mcfarlane point out the obvious, \nwhoever whats to live in the west is a idiot. Theres snakes, desperados, \nand scalping.'
p81
aS'this was so messed up but so funny at the same time :) '
p82
aS'Tbh the best bit was the end DJANGO'
p83
aS'this movie was shit'
p84
aS'The name of this movie has nothing to do with the flim, its exactly like \nthey just put 100 random names in a hat and picked one.'
p85
aS"Looks kind of corny like a monty python western comedy or something.  I \nlike western comedies but this doesn't have a sense of the time. It looks \nlike a 2014 western from using words like awesome. Probably has a cowboy \nsomewhere in it that says, cool dude or what's up bro. At least western \ncomedies like North to alaska or mclintock left you feeling like it was the \n1800's and not some monty python flying circus western.  \nGuess some may like it but think I'll pass on this one. "
p86
aS"Liam Neeson isn't killing anyone in this scene"
p87
aS'This movie was so boring, i tried to like it and i couldnt wait for it to \nend, just not a funny movie at all, unless you are 10yrs old i suppose.'
p88
aS'He friendzoned Charlize Theron... Seriously dude?'
p89
aS'best western movie hahaha laught so manny times :D'
p90

p91
aS'I watched the movie when it first came out'
p92
aS'The book was better'
p93
aS'GOOD MOVIE!!!! :D'
p94
aS"you know what you never see when movies like this come out? white people \ncomplaining about racist white jokes. get over it people, if you can't \nlaugh at yourself you have no sense of humor and no right to laugh at \nanything else"
p95
aS"I saw this yesterday and it has to be one of the most disgusting, not-funny \nand uncreative movies I've seen lately. I still don't get how desperated \ncould Liam Neeson and Charlize Theron be to part take in this piece of \nshit. "
