aS'Hey I found out a big combination! And the combination is including the \npirate fairy in it well it\'s more than a combination it\'s more like a \nconnection and I will make a video of this very soon when I\'m aloud to ok \nso the connection is.......\n\nDisney fairies (the pirate fairy) are connected to make and the neverland \npirates, and name and the neverland pirates connected to Peter Pan! Peter \nPan connected to tinkerbell, and tinkerbell is connected to disney fairies! \nThere\'s must be a connection and I will said it once again but clearly ok \nso the "pirate fairy" has James in it right? And James is going to be \nCaptain Hook! You can see it by your own eyes if you don\'t stop the movie \njust watch it until the end because there will showed up mr smith from jake \nand the neverland pirates keep watching until you see it dont turn it off! \nAnd so the pirate fairy was connected to jake and neverland pirates, and \njake and the neverland pirates was connected to Peter Pan once! And there\'s \ntinkerbell in Peter Pan right?? And tinkerbell is connected to disney \nfairies and disney fairies has the movie "pirate fairy" so do anyone get \nit? It\'s a very good connection! And an interesting one!'

p7
aS'Lol it sounds like my sisters name\n'
p8
aS'its awesome.'
p9
aS'Can\'t believe I missed this in my local cinemas because it was under a \ndifferent name "The Pirate Fairy" I guess I\'ll have to wait for the Blu Ray \nrelease now :('
p10
aS'there should be one about tink and terrance'
p11
aS'In terms of visual / audio quality this movie is barely above a tv special. \nIts also not very entertaining.'
p12
aS'added to download list :D'
p13
aS'I saw the movie it was good '
p14
aS'Frozen\n'

aS'I love this movie so funny!!!!'
p20
aS'EVEN IF ITS A GIRL MOVIE IT LOOKS GOOD'
p21
aS"We're getting to the Peter Pan theme closer and closer with every new \nmovie. One of the coming-up movies should surely be about Tink meeting \nPeter!))"
p22
aS'Very disappointing and also added nothing to the story of Peter Pan or Hook \nor Tinkerbell. Besides the movie secret of the wings was very nice but this \nwas dumb as a filler episode for television. Besides the proximity of \nTinkerbel are no longer saw his sister Periwinkle and again set aside the \ncharacter of Terence.'
p23
aS'Like this post if you think they should make a Tinkerbell movie about Tink \nmeeting Peter Pan. '
p24
aS'omg they shud make one where tinker bell meets peter pan!!!!!!!!!!'

p28
aS'i was a bit disappointed i thought there going to put mermaids on it i was \nso excited about it then i no see mermaids.'
p29
aS'Muy decepcionante y ademas no aporto nada a la historia de Peter Pan ni de \nGarfio o Tinkerbell. Ademas la pelcula del secreto de las alas estuvo muy \nlinda pero esta fue mediocre como un episodio de relleno para la \ntelevisin. Ademas ya no se vea la cercana de Tinkerbel con su hermana \nPeriwinkle y otra vez dejaron de lado el personaje de Terence.'
p30
aS'frozen is awsome man!!!!'
p31
aS'En. Ingles'
p32
aS'TOMMY!!!!! I have to see this movie.'
p33
aS'Went to see this film last week in 3D, it was pretty good the only thing \nis, first this film is only an hour and 10 miniutes long so yeah its pretty \nshort, second the 3D is barely there and third the movie is only in \ntheaters in the uk, the us (were the film was made) have a direct to dvd \nrealease, so yeah long story short id say its not my faveourite tinkerbell \nmovie'

p39
aS'well now we no how the crock from peter pan came from and how the ship was \nable to fly'
p40
aS"Looks cute but I'll never consider these films canon with the classic \nDisney Peter Pan movie. Tinkerbell is so different in these, she's more of \na femme-fairy-fatale in the classic film. I feel they've watered-down her \ncharacter here..."
p41
aS'Good movie. Took my little sister to see this.'
p42

p44
aS'I watched this movie online it was great :D'
p45
aS"I'm so cuirious to see it alredy"
p46
aS"I've disliked this to try and ensure it doesn't reappear in my recommended \nvideos. At best Google's algorithm lumped my watching of a trailer for How \nto train your dragon 2 in with this since they're similar animation styles. \nGoogle needs to adjust that algorithm so it's more specific. Even if that \nmeans tweaking the entire program."
