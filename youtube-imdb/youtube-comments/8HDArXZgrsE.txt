p3
aS"i saw it yesterday , it's a great movie !"
p4
aS'Time to hang up the gloves arnie'
p5
aS"I am really fed up with the police stories to be honest, and i just watched \nreal footage of a swat team shoot a homeless unarmed man to death in a \nnational park in Alberquerque.  American police don't seem the heroes \nhollywood paint them to be.  Hard to buy into the fantasy when you see how \nthey are turning out."
p6
aS"that last scene! I can't stop quoting it in Arnold's voice (Spoilers)\n\nBreacher: You're mine.\n[knocks his hat off and pins him down on top of the urinal icecubes] \nBrujo: You wife - I was the last to have her. You can't take that back.\nBreacher: I can take *your* family.\nBrujo: No!\nBreacher: But I'm not like you.\n\nBoom! (Shot to the head)"
p7
aS'Damnnnn man this guy will never retire?! he will die on the scene i think \nan his last words wil be .... ???!!    "I Will Be Back" :))'
p8
aS'This looks so unbelieviable bad, I have to watch it!'
p9
aS"Well, I've seen better movies, to be honest, this was one of the worst \nmovies I've seen in a long time. It was a barely tolerable, and mediocre, \ncookie cutter police (DEA) action movie until the last half killed it \ncompletely. Dumb movie made worse by the finale of the film (technically \nthe second to last gun fight / chase scene)."
p10
aS'Kim'

aS'arnold is one of the greatest actors of all time ....this movie was alright \nexpected more though from the cast full of potential'

p13
aS'Another movie where the hero is still the best cop in the world at 70 years \nold. Filled with cliches and been there seen that scenes. I bet there\'s a \npart where Arnold explodes something and casually walks away. Or stabs \nsomeone and says "stick around". Geez I\'m so sick of these has been stars \nmaking these "straight to video" movies. Oh and I love the way they try to \nmake that woman cop a real bad ass. Give me a break. '

p15
aS'What sucks is how misleading the trailer is to what the actual movie is \nabout. '
p16
aS'The black guy did it :) enjoy'
p17
aS'The story line is good but I think they messed up with one thing, like some \nmovies typically do. A white woman investigator who acts all macho and her \nblack assistant... lol '
p18
aS'GET TO THE CHOPPAAAA!! '
p19
aS'best actor ever!'

p24
aS'Alcides???????'
p25
aS'Looks like something from the 90s. But have to see it just cos arnold is in \nit.  '
p26
aS"Most swearing in a movie I've ever watched. It's so stupid and unnecessary. \nRuins the whole movie. Yeah, it's rated R and I understand there's going to \nbe swearing but in this movie... It's just omg! Every sentence, I swear. "
p27
aS'LoL We got 2 Terminators here!'
p28
aS'Wow! He looks older every passing day'
p29
aS"Sabotage is AWESOME! Don't let the reviewers tell you otherwise! PLUS the \nguy that did the voice for Alex Mason in Call of Duty Black Ops is in the \nmovie. That's just simply AWESOME too! Go see it!"
p30
aS"This is the worst piece of TURD I have ever seen. This movie deserves an \nOSCAR for worst movie of the decade. I don't understand why Arnold \nSchwarzenegger keep signing up for these films, does he not read the \nscripts before? I don't think he needs the money. Why does he not take his \ntime and choose wisely? Follow Mathew McConaughey's lead,try something \nfresh."
p31
aS'YEAH DADDY!'

p40
aS"It wasn't that bad but the lone woman in the group playing Sam \nWorthington's wife made the movie not watchable. She destroyed the movie. \nLooked like a miscast. She tried too hard, it hurt to watch. Sorry it's a \nthumbs down "
p41
aS"One of the worst movies ever. The director is some kind of idiot or retard. \nAnd there's an allseeing eye and 1% sign in the movie, they couldn't leave \nthat out as well, typical. If you wanna be bored and like someone fuckin' \nup with your brains, go watch this movie"

aS"Don't waste your money."
p50
aS"Best Arnold movie in years ands maybe ever!!! This isn't cheesy like the \ndone in the past and definitely worth seeing."
p51
aS"I watched this movie and this trailer is like it's for a completely \ndifferent movie. In the trailer they make u think that u know what the plot \nof the movie is but truly they are completely steering u into a completely \ndifferent direction. It kinda pissed me off in a way while watching it. I \ndon't know why."
p52
aS'IDK, it looks pretty good, but the lesbo chick kinda puts me off..... What \ndo you guys think?'
p53

p71
aS' ,        ???'
p72
aS'Is it neccessary to say F*ck and Sh*t every damn second ? '
p73
aS'The movie was OK.\nI expected it to be dumb, vulgar and brutal and that\'s what I got.\nI liked the action scenes and the gore.\nDespite the humor in this being very low brow, I laughed more than when \nwatching most modern "comedies".\nI always see people bitching about every movie that ever comes out these \ndays and most of it is undeserved.\n\nYou want to know what a bad movie is? Watch Meet the Spartans. Better yet, \nDON\'T watch Meet the Spartans.'
p74
aS'Arnold Schwarzenner does not need to hang up the gloves just yet...'

p87
aS'arnold and sylvester need to stop acting asap.  the best shit arnold did \nwas comedies and terminator (where he is a robot and isnt required to do \nmuch acting at all)   sylvesters best movie was demolition man.  everything \nelse is puss.'
p88
aS'dude...arnold got pretty old... but he wil always be awesome :D'
p89
aS'The trailer makes the film look good, but in reality, it was horrendously \nterrible, i think i feel asleep through it.'
p90
aS'What a trainwreck of a movie. Awful in every way possible. Arnold is trying \nso hard to save this movie from falling to pieces but with convoluted plot, \nterrible screenplay, over the top acting and really dumb ending it is \njust unsalvageable. 0,5 / 5.'
p91
aS"Shit movie. Just finished watching it and it was hands down the worst movie \nI've ever watched. And I've watched rubber til the end."
